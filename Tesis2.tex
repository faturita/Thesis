% 1. use the "modern" or "classic" option to switch between 
% a modern or classic font, respectively.
%
% 2. add/remove the "hyperref" option to enable/disable hyperlinks:
% (remember to remove auxiliary files after adding/removing 
% the "hyperref" option).
%
% 3. add/remove the "printer" option to typeset a printer-friendly 
% (grayscale)/color version of the thesis.
%
% 4. use the "watermark" option to indicate a draft copy of the thesis
%
% 5. use the "histinit" option to enable "historiated initials".
% (If used, all chapter initials declared by the \InitialCharacter{}
% macro are enlarged. If ommitted, arguments of \InitialCharacter{}
% are typeset as normal text.)
%
% 6. use the "plain" option to disable tikz graphics in title page
% and part/chapter headers (might help to avoid compilation timeouts).
% Note that "plain" disables CD label and CD cover creation.
%
% 7. use the "noindex" option to (hopefully) avoid compilation timeouts
% when compiling online (disables index generation - note that "\indexGR",
% "\index" invocations need not be removed when toggling this option).
%
% 8. use the "frontispiece" option to typeset a frontispiece at the back of the cover page
%
% 9. use the `letter' option for a US letter page layout, instead of A4
