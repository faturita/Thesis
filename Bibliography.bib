@article{VandenBerg2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Extracting relevant biological information from large data sets is a major challenge in functional genomics research. Different aspects of the data hamper their biological interpretation. For instance, 5000-fold differences in concentration for different metabolites are present in a metabolomics data set, while these differences are not proportional to the biological relevance of these metabolites. However, data analysis methods are not able to make this distinction. Data pretreatment methods can correct for aspects that hinder the biological interpretation of metabolomics data sets by emphasizing the biological information in the data set and thus improving their biological interpretability. RESULTS Different data pretreatment methods, i.e. centering, autoscaling, pareto scaling, range scaling, vast scaling, log transformation, and power transformation, were tested on a real-life metabolomics data set. They were found to greatly affect the outcome of the data analysis and thus the rank of the, from a biological point of view, most important metabolites. Furthermore, the stability of the rank, the influence of technical errors on data analysis, and the preference of data analysis methods for selecting highly abundant metabolites were affected by the data pretreatment method used prior to data analysis. CONCLUSION Different pretreatment methods emphasize different aspects of the data and each pretreatment method has its own merits and drawbacks. The choice for a pretreatment method depends on the biological question to be answered, the properties of the data set and the data analysis method selected. For the explorative analysis of the validation data set used in this study, autoscaling and range scaling performed better than the other pretreatment methods. That is, range scaling and autoscaling were able to remove the dependence of the rank of the metabolites on the average concentration and the magnitude of the fold changes and showed biologically sensible results after PCA (principal component analysis).In conclusion, selecting a proper data pretreatment method is an essential step in the analysis of metabolomics data and greatly affects the metabolites that are identified to be the most important.},

@article{Neumann2003,
abstract = {Objectives: Direct brain-computer communication uses self regulation of brain potentials to select letters, words, or symbols from a computer menu to re-establish communication in severely paralysed patients. However, not all healthy subjects, or all paralysed patients acquire the skill to self regulate their brain potentials, and predictors of successful learning have not been found yet. Predictors are particularly important, because only successful self regulation will in the end lead to efficient brain-computer communication. This study investigates the question whether initial performance in the self regulation of slow cortical potentials of the brain (SCPs) may be positively correlated to later performance and could thus be used as a predictor. Methods: Five severely paralysed patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were trained to produce SCP amplitudes of negative and positive polarity by means of visual feedback and operant conditioning strategies. Performance was measured as percentage of correct SCP amplitude shifts. To determine the relation between initial and later performance in SCP self regulation, Spearman's rank correlations were calculated between maximum and mean performance at the beginning of training (runs 1–30) and mean performance at two later time points (runs 64–93 and 162–191). Results: Spearman's rank correlations revealed a significant relation between maximum and mean performance in runs 1–30 and mean performance in runs 64–93 (r= 0.9 and 1.0) and maximum and mean performance in runs 1–30 and mean performance in runs 162–191 (r=1.0 and 1.0). Conclusions: Initial performance in the self regulation of SCP is positively correlated with later performance in severely paralysed patients, and thus represents a useful predictor for efficient brain-computer communication.},

We have shown that people, including those with severe motor disabilities, can learn to use sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) to move a cursor rapidly and accurately in one or two dimensions. We have also improved P300-based BCI operation. We are now translating this laboratory-proven BCI technology into a system that can be used by severely disabled people in their homes with minimal ongoing technical oversight. To accomplish this, we have: improved our general-purpose BCI software (BCI2000); improved online adaptation and feature translation for SMR-based BCI operation; improved the accuracy and bandwidth of P300-based BCI operation; reduced the complexity of system hardware and software and begun to evaluate home system use in appropriate users. These developments have resulted in prototype systems for every day use in people's homes.},

abstract = {It is now generally accepted that EEG is the only reliable way to accurately detect newborn seizures and, as such, prolonged EEG monitoring is increasingly being adopted in neonatal intensive care units. Long EEG recordings may last from several hours to a few days. With neurophysiologists not always available to review the EEG during unsociable hours, there is a pressing need to develop a reliable and robust automatic seizure detection methodda computer algorithm that can take the EEG signal, process it, and output information that supports clinical decision making. In this study, we review existing algorithms based on how the relevant seizure information is exploited. We start with commonly used methods to extract signatures from seizure signals that range from those that mimic the clinical neurophysiologist to those that exploit mathematical models of neonatal EEG generation. Commonly used classification methods are reviewed that are based on a set of rules and thresholds that are either heuristically tuned or automatically derived from the data. These are followed by techniques to use information about spatiotemporal seizure context. The usual errors in system design and validation are discussed. Current clinical decision support tools that have met regulatory requirements and are available to detect neonatal seizures are reviewed with progress and the outstanding challenges are outlined. This review discusses the current state of the art regarding automatic detection of neonatal seizures.},

@article{Fedele2012,
abstract = {Objective: Scalp-derived human somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) contain high-frequency oscillations (600. Hz; 'sigma-burst') reflecting concomitant bursts of spike responses in primary somatosensory cortex that repeat regularly at 600. Hz. Notably, recent human intracranial SEP have revealed also 1. kHz responses ('kappa-burst'), possibly reflecting non-rhythmic spiking summed over multiple cells (MUA: multi-unit activity). However, the non-invasive detection of EEG signals at 1. kHz typical for spikes has always been limited by noise contributions from both, amplifier and body/electrode interface. Accordingly, we developed a low-noise recording set-up optimised to map non-invasively 1. kHz SEP components. Methods: SEP were recorded upon 4. Hz left median nerve stimulation in 6 healthy human subjects. Scalp potentials were acquired inside an electrically and magnetically shielded room using low-noise custom-made amplifiers. Furthermore, in order to reduce thermal Johnson noise contributions from the sensor/skin interface, electrode impedances were adjusted to ≤1. k$\Omega$. Responses averaged after repeated presentation of the stimulus (n=. 4000 trials) were evaluated by spatio-temporal pattern analyses in complementary spectral bands. Results: Three distinct spectral components were identified: N20 ({\textless}100. Hz), sigma-burst (450-750. Hz), and kappa-burst (850-1200. Hz). The two high-frequency bursts (sigma, kappa) exhibited distinct and partially independent spatiotemporal evolutions, indicating subcortical as well as several cortical generators. Conclusions: Using a dedicated low-noise set-up, human SEP 'kappa-bursts' at 1. kHz can be non-invasively detected and their scalp distribution be mapped. Their topographies indicate a set of subcortical/cortical generators, at least partially distinct from the topography of the 600. Hz sigma-bursts described previously. Significance: The non-invasive detection and surface mapping of 1. kHz EEG signals presented here provides an essential step towards non-invasive monitoring of multi-unit spike activity. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

@article{Vanhatalo2005,
abstract = {While enormous resources have been recently invested into the development of a variety of neuroimaging techniques, the bandwidth of the clinical EEG, originally set by trivial technical limitations, has remained practically unaltered for over 50 years. An increasing amount of evidence shows that salient EEG signals are observed beyond the bandwidth of the routine clinical EEG, which is typically around 0.5-50 Hz. Physiological and pathological EEG activity ranges at least from 0.01 Hz to several hundred Hz, as demonstrated in recordings of spontaneous activity in the immature human brain, as well as during epileptic seizures, or various kinds of cognitive tasks and states in the adult brain. In the present paper, we will review several arguments leading to the conclusion that elimination of the lower (infraslow) or higher (ultrafast) bands of the EEG frequency spectrum in routine EEG leads to situations where salient and physiologically meaningful features of brain activity are ignored. Recording the full, physiologically relevant range of frequencies is readily attained with commercially available direct-current (DC) coupled amplifiers, which have a wide dynamic range and a high sampling rate. Such amplifiers, combined with appropriate DC-stable electrode-skin interface, provide a genuine full-band EEG (FbEEG). FbEEG is mandatory for a faithful, non-distorted and non-attenuated recording, and it does not have trade-offs that would favor any frequency band at the expense of another. With the currently available electrode, amplifier and data acquisition technology, FbEEG is likely to become the standard approach for a wide range of applications in both basic science and in the clinic. {\textcopyright} 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

the present work suggests a relation between PeEn-based complexity

to approximate the centroid of its weighted power spectrum. To substantiate
this proposition, a systematic approach based on redundancy reduction
is introduced and applied to sleep and epileptic seizure EEG. The

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to signal waveform analysis in the
frequency range of 1 to 50 Hz. The technique is applicable to any
waveform which is a single valued function of time with continuous
derivatives. The main application of this system has been on the
human EEG. The analyzer, to be described, performs its analysis in
the time domain and abstracts wave shape information from the original
wave and from the successive mathematical derivatives of that wave.
The output from this analyzer consists of six analog descriptors
of the input EEG wave. These descriptors are basic amplitude and
basic frequency of the original input wave, amplitude and frequency
of the first derivative of the input wave, and amplitude and frequency
of the second derivative of the input wave.},

@article{Simons2016,
abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in
the world. Symptoms include progressive memory, cognitive and behavioural
changes before death, caused by amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorated
tau in the brain. The cause of AD is currently unknown and current
interventions only slow the decline. Diagnosis is based on patient
and familial history, interviews with close family and friends, cognitive,
mental and physical tests. The electroencephalogram (EEG) records
the electrical signals of the brain, which AD, as a cortical dementia,
is known to directly affect. Non-linear signal processing has shown
that these changes in the EEG can be identified with complementary
findings to linear methods. This thesis aimed to explore these changes
with novel univariate and bivariate methods using both synthetic
signals and resting, eyes-closed EEGs recorded from 22 subjects,
11 AD patients (MMSE=13.1±5.9 (mean SD)) and 11 age-matched controls
(30±0). Permutation entropy showed statistically significant increased
complexity in control EEGs for electrodes at the front of the head.
Bivariate analysis was novel for this EEG database so coherence was
used to create a comparison results set. With the success of Lempel-Ziv
Complexity (LZC), distance based bivariate forms were applied (dLZC03).
Novel normalisation methods based on that for univariate LZC showed
a greater representation of the signal patterns in the results. Volume
conduction was shown to significantly impact the results, both of
coherence and dLZC03, though this was greater with coherence. Lastly,
volume conduction mitigated, bandwidth based pre filtering with dLZC03
was calculated, producing the most significant p values ever recorded
with this EEG database. Thus this PhD shows increased distinction
between the two subject groups with dLZC03 over LZC and increased
distinction with limited but targeted bandwidths from those subject
signals.},

@article{Lindeberg2013,
abstract = {A receptive field constitutes a region in the visual field where a visual cell or a visual operator responds to visual stimuli. This paper presents a theory for what types of receptive field profiles can be regarded as natural for an idealized vision system, given a set of structural requirements on the first stages of visual processing that reflect symmetry properties of the surrounding world. These symmetry properties include (i) covariance properties under scale changes, affine image deformations, and Galilean transformations of space-time as occur for real-world image data as well as specific requirements of (ii) temporal causality implying that the future cannot be accessed and (iii) a time-recursive updating mechanism of a limited temporal buffer of the past as is necessary for a genuine real-time system. Fundamental structural requirements are also imposed to ensure (iv) mutual consistency and a proper handling of internal representations at different spatial and temporal scales. It is shown how a set of families of idealized receptive field profiles can be derived by necessity regarding spatial, spatio-chromatic, and spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of Gaussian kernels, Gaussian derivatives, or closely related operators. Such image filters have been successfully used as a basis for expressing a large number of visual operations in computer vision, regarding feature detection, feature classification, motion estimation, object recognition, spatio-temporal recognition, and shape estimation. Hence, the associated so-called scale-space theory constitutes a both theoretically well-founded and general framework for expressing visual operations. There are very close similarities between receptive field profiles predicted from this scale-space theory and receptive field profiles found by cell recordings in biological vision. Among the family of receptive field profiles derived by necessity from the assumptions, idealized models with very good qualitative agreement are obtained for (i) spatial on-center/off-surround and off-center/on-surround receptive fields in the fovea and the LGN, (ii) simple cells with spatial directional preference in V1, (iii) spatio-chromatic double-opponent neurons in V1, (iv) space-time separable spatio-temporal receptive fields in the LGN and V1, and (v) non-separable space-time tilted receptive fields in V1, all within the same unified theory. In addition, the paper presents a more general framework for relating and interpreting these receptive fields conceptually and possibly predicting new receptive field profiles as well as for pre-wiring covariance under scaling, affine, and Galilean transformations into the representations of visual stimuli. This paper describes the basic structure of the necessity results concerning receptive field profiles regarding the mathematical foundation of the theory and outlines how the proposed theory could be used in further studies and modelling of biological vision. It is also shown how receptive field responses can be interpreted physically, as the superposition of relative variations of surface structure and illumination variations, given a logarithmic brightness scale, and how receptive field measurements will be invariant under multiplicative illumination variations and exposure control mechanisms.},

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds.},

@article{Haegens2014,
abstract = {Converging electrophysiological evidence suggests that the alpha rhythm plays an important and active role in cognitive processing. Here, we systematically studied variability in posterior alpha peak frequency both between and within subjects. We recorded brain activity using MEG in 51 healthy human subjects under three experimental conditions - rest, passive visual stimulation and an N-back working memory paradigm, using source reconstruction methods to separate alpha activity from parietal and occipital sources. We asked how alpha peak frequency differed within subjects across cognitive conditions and regions of interest, and looked at the distribution of alpha peak frequency between subjects. In both regions we observed an increase of alpha peak frequency from resting state and passive visual stimulation conditions to the N-back paradigm, with a significantly higher alpha peak frequency in the 2-back compared to the 0-back condition. There was a trend for a greater increase in alpha peak frequency during the N-back task in the occipital vs. parietal cortex. The average alpha peak frequency across all subjects, conditions, and regions of interest was 10.3. Hz with a within-subject SD of 0.9. Hz and a between-subject SD of 2.8. Hz. We also measured beta peak frequencies, and except in the parietal cortex during rest, found no indication of a strictly harmonic relationship with alpha peak frequencies. We conclude that alpha peak frequency in posterior regions increases with increasing cognitive demands, and that the alpha rhythm operates across a wider frequency range than the 8-12. Hz band many studies tend to include in their analysis. Thus, using a fixed and limited alpha frequency band might bias results against certain subjects and conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

Hz (Alpha) are one of the fundamental research areas in neuroscience. In recent decades, analysis of this activity has been not only the focus of interest for description of sensory-cognitive processes, but has also led to trials for establishing new hypotheses. The present review and the companion review aim to constitute an ensemble of "reasonings and suggestions" to understand alpha oscillations based on a wide range of accumulated findings rather than a trial to launch a new "alpha theory". Surveyed descriptions related to physiology and brain function: The review starts with descriptions of earlier extracellular recordings, field potentials and also considers earlier alpha hypotheses. Analytical descriptions of evoked and event-related responses, event-related desynchronization, the relationship between spontaneous activity and evoked potentials, aging brain, pathology and alpha response in cognitive impairment are in the content of this review. In essence, the gamut of the survey includes a multiplicity of evidence on functional correlates in sensory processing, cognition, memory and vegetative system, including the spinal cord and heart. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Current brain-computer interface (BCIs) software is often tailored to the needs of scientists and technicians and therefore complex to allow for versatile use. To facilitate home use of BCIs a multifunctional P300 BCI with a graphical user interface intended for non-expert set-up and control was designed and implemented. The system includes applications for spelling, web access, entertainment, artistic expression and environmental control. In addition to new software, it also includes new hardware for the recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The EEG system consists of a small and wireless amplifier attached to a cap that can be equipped with gel-based or dry contact electrodes. The system was systematically evaluated with a healthy sample, and targeted end users of BCI technology, i.e., people with a varying degree of motor impairment tested the BCI in a series of individual case studies. Usability was assessed in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. Feedback of users was gathered with structured questionnaires. Two groups of healthy participants completed an experimental protocol with the gel-based and the dry contact electrodes (N = 10 each). The results demonstrated that all healthy participants gained control over the system and achieved satisfactory to high accuracies with both gel-based and dry electrodes (average error rates of 6 and 13{\%}). Average satisfaction ratings were high, but certain aspects of the system such as the wearing comfort of the dry electrodes and design of the cap, and speed (in both groups) were criticized by some participants. Six potential end users tested the system during supervised sessions. The achieved accuracies varied greatly from no control to high control with accuracies comparable to that of healthy volunteers. Satisfaction ratings of the two end-users that gained control of the system were lower as compared to healthy participants. The advantages and disadvantages of the BCI and its applications are discussed and suggestions are presented for improvements to pave the way for user friendly BCIs intended to be used as assistive technology by persons with severe paralysis.},

abstract = {Objective: Visual assessment of the EEG still outperforms current computer algorithms in detecting epileptiform discharges. Deep learning is a promising novel approach, being able to learn from large datasets. Here, we show pilot results of detecting epileptiform discharges using deep neural networks. Methods: We selected 50 EEGs from focal epilepsy patients. All epileptiform discharges (n = 1815) were annotated by an experienced neurophysiologist and extracted as 2 s epochs. In addition, 50 normal EEGs were divided into 2 s epochs. All epochs were divided into a training (n = 41,381) and test (n = 8775) set. We implemented several combinations of convolutional and recurrent neural networks, providing the probability for the presence of epileptiform discharges. The network with the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) in the test set was validated on seven independent EEGs with focal epileptiform discharges and twelve normal EEGs. Results: The final network had an AUC of 0.94 for the test set. Validation allowed detection of epileptiform discharges with 47.4{\%} sensitivity and 98.0{\%} specificity (FPR: 0.6/min). For the normal EEGs in the validation set, the specificity was 99.9{\%} (FPR: 0.03/min). Conclusions: Deep neural networks can accurately detect epileptiform discharges from scalp EEG recordings. Significance: Deep learning may result in a fundamental shift in clinical EEG analysis.},

As a consequence the shape and the peak amplitude of the averaged ERP are smeared and reduced, respectively, when the single-trial latencies show a relevant variability. To date, the majority of the methodologies for single-trial latencies inference are iterative schemes providing suboptimal solutions, the most commonly used being the Woody's algorithm. Approach. In this study, a global approach is developed by introducing a fitness function whose global maximum corresponds to the set of latencies which renders the trial signals most aligned as possible. A suitable genetic algorithm has been implemented to solve the optimization problem, characterized by new genetic operators tailored to the present problem. Main results. The results, on simulated trials, showed that the proposed algorithm performs better than Woody's algorithm in all conditions, at the cost of an increased computational complexity (justified by the improved quality of the solution). Application of the proposed approach on real data trials, resulted in an increased correlation between latencies and reaction times w.r.t. the output from RIDE method. Significance. The above mentioned results on simulated and real data indicate that the proposed method, providing a better estimate of single-trial latencies, will open the way to more accurate study of neural responses as well as to the issue of relating the variability of latencies to the proper cognitive and behavioural correlates.},

abstract = {Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the weak electromagnetic signals generated by neuronal activity in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate neural activation in the brain is a challenge that requires expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics, and numerical methods. As part of the MNE software suite, MNE-Python is an open-source software package that addresses this challenge by providing state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python that cover multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python libraries for scientific comptutation (NumPy, SciPy) and visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The code is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse, even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has only been under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code development to help share best practices. MNE-Python also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of methods by other researchers. Full documentation, including dozens of examples, is available at http://martinos.org/mne.},

abstract = {Clinical electroencephalography (EEG) records vast amounts of human complex data yet is still reviewed primarily by human readers. Deep belief nets (DBNs) are a relatively new type of multi-layer neural network commonly tested on two-dimensional image data but are rarely applied to times-series data such as EEG. We apply DBNs in a semi-supervised paradigm to model EEG waveforms for classification and anomaly detection. DBN performance was comparable to standard classifiers on our EEG dataset, and classification time was found to be 1.7-103.7 times faster than the other high-performing classifiers. We demonstrate how the unsupervised step of DBN learning produces an autoencoder that can naturally be used in anomaly measurement. We compare the use of raw, unprocessed data--a rarity in automated physiological waveform analysis--with hand-chosen features and find that raw data produce comparable classification and better anomaly measurement performance. These results indicate that DBNs and raw data inputs may be more effective for online automated EEG waveform recognition than other common techniques.},

Although the major contributor of the extracellular signal is the synaptic transmembrane current, other sources--including Na(+) and Ca(2+) spikes, ionic fluxes through voltage- and ligand-gated channels, and intrinsic membrane oscillations--can substantially shape the extracellular field. High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.},

ERPs consist of multiple components and reflect a specific neurocognitive process. In the past, there was no single source that could be consulted to learn about all the major ERP components; learning about a single ERP component required reading dozens or even hundreds of separate journal articles and book chapters. The Oxford Handbook of Event-Related Potential Components fills this longstanding void with a detailed and comprehensive review of the major ERP components. Comprising 22 chapters by the field's founders and leading researchers, this volume offers extensive coverage of all relevant topics: -the fundamental nature of ERP components, including essential information about how ERP components are defined and isolated -individual components, such as the N170, P300, and ERN -groups of related components within specific research domains, such as language, emotion, and memory -ERP components in special populations, including children, the elderly, nonhuman primates, and patients with neurological disorders, affective disorders, and schizophrenia While undeniably broad in scope, these chapters are accessible to novices while remaining informative and engaging to experts.

Handbook of EEG Interpretation, the first illustrated, portable handbook to discuss all aspects of clinical neurophysiology, is an essential means of quick reference for anyone involved in EEG interpretation. Handbook of EEG Interpretation provides practical information on reading EEGs by juxtaposing actual EEGs with bullet points of critical information, making it an essential neurophysiology reference for use during bedside, OR, ER, and ICU EEG interpretation. At once more concise, illustrative, and portable than other texts on EEG, Handbook of EEG Interpretation fits in a labcoat pocket, providing immediate information for anyone involved in EEG interpretation. It is a useful tool for all residents, fellows, and clinicians in neurology as well as many internists, psychiatrists, neurosurgeons, anesthesiologists, ICU staff, ER staff, EEG technologists, and nurses.

abstract = {The proportion of signal elements embedded in noise needed to detect a signal is a standard tool for investigating motion perception. This paradigm was applied to the shape domain to determine how local information is pooled into a global percept. Stimulus arrays consisted of oriented Gabor elements that sampled the circumference of concentric radial frequency (RF) patterns. Individual Gabors were oriented tangentially to the shape (signal) or randomly (noise). In different conditions, signal elements were located randomly within the entire array or constrained to fall along one of the concentric contours. Coherence thresholds were measured for RF patterns with various frequencies (number of corners) and amplitudes ("sharpness" of corners). Coherence thresholds (about 10{\%} = 15 elements) were lowest for circular shapes. Manipulating shape frequency or amplitude showed a range where thresholds remain unaffected (frequency ≤ RF4; amplitude ≤ 0.05). Increasing either parameter caused thresholds to rise. Compared to circles, thresholds increased by approximately four times for RF13 and five times for amplitudes of 0.3. Confining the signals to individual contours significantly reduced the number of elements needed to reach threshold (between 4 and 6), independent of the total number of elements on the contour or contour shape. Finally, adding external noise to the orientation of the elements had a greater effect on detection thresholds than adding noise to their position. These results provide evidence for a series of highly sensitive, shape-specific analysers which sum information globally but only from within specific annuli. These global mechanisms are tuned to position and orientation of local elements from which they pool information. The overall performance for arrays of elements can be explained by the sensitivity of multiple, independent concentric shape detectors rather than a single detector integrating information widely across space (e.g. Glass pattern detector).},

@article{Simons2016,
abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the world. Symptoms include progressive memory, cognitive and behavioural changes before death, caused by amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorated tau in the brain. The cause of AD is currently unknown and current interventions only slow the decline. Diagnosis is based on patient and familial history, interviews with close family and friends, cognitive, mental and physical tests. The electroencephalogram (EEG) records the electrical signals of the brain, which AD, as a cortical dementia, is known to directly affect. Non-linear signal processing has shown that these changes in the EEG can be identified with complementary findings to linear methods. This thesis aimed to explore these changes with novel univariate and bivariate methods using both synthetic signals and resting, eyes-closed EEGs recorded from 22 subjects, 11 AD patients (MMSE=13.1±5.9 (mean SD)) and 11 age-matched controls (30±0). Permutation entropy showed statistically significant increased complexity in control EEGs for electrodes at the front of the head. Bivariate analysis was novel for this EEG database so coherence was used to create a comparison results set. With the success of Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), distance based bivariate forms were applied (dLZC03). Novel normalisation methods based on that for univariate LZC showed a greater representation of the signal patterns in the results. Volume conduction was shown to significantly impact the results, both of coherence and dLZC03, though this was greater with coherence. Lastly, volume conduction mitigated, bandwidth based pre filtering with dLZC03 was calculated, producing the most significant p values ever recorded with this EEG database. Thus this PhD shows increased distinction between the two subject groups with dLZC03 over LZC and increased distinction with limited but targeted bandwidths from those subject signals.},

abstract = {We describe current efforts to implement and improve P300-BCI communication tools. The P300 Speller first described by Farwell and Donchin (in 1988) adapted the so-called oddball paradigm (OP) as the operating principle of the brain-computer interface (BCI) and was the first P300-BCI. The system operated by briefly intensifying each row and column of a matrix and the attended row and column elicited a P300 response. This paradigm has been the benchmark in P300-BCI systems, and in the past few years the P300 Speller paradigm has been solidified as a promising communication tool. While promising, we have found that some people who have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) would be better suited with a system that has a limited number of choices, particularly if the 6 x 6 matrix is difficult to use. Therefore, we used the OP to implement a four-choice system using the commands: Yes, No, Pass, and End; we also used three presentation modes: auditory, visual, and auditory and visual. We summarize results from both paradigms and also discuss obstacles we have identified while working with the ALS population outside of the laboratory environment.},

@article{Michel2012,
abstract = {Recent advances in signal analysis have engendered EEG with the status of a true brain mapping and brain imaging method capable of providing spatio-temporal information regarding brain (dys)function. Because of the increasing interest in the temporal dynamics of brain networks, and because of the straightforward compatibility of the EEG with other brain imaging techniques, EEG is increasingly used in the neuroimaging community. However, the full capability of EEG is highly underestimated. Many combined EEG-fMRI studies use the EEG only as a spike-counter or an oscilloscope. Many cognitive and clinical EEG studies use the EEG still in its traditional way and analyze grapho-elements at certain electrodes and latencies. We here show that this way of using the EEG is not only dangerous because it leads to misinterpretations, but it is also largely ignoring the spatial aspects of the signals. In fact, EEG primarily measures the electric potential field at the scalp surface in the same way as MEG measures the magnetic field. By properly sampling and correctly analyzing this electric field, EEG can provide reliable information about the neuronal activity in the brain and the temporal dynamics of this activity in the millisecond range. This review explains some of these analysis methods and illustrates their potential in clinical and experimental applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Objectives To identify perceptions among people with spinal cord injury (SCI) of the priorities for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and design features along with the time investment and risk acceptable to obtain a BCI. Design Survey. Setting Research registry participants surveyed via telephone and BCI usage study participants surveyed in person before BCI use. Participants Convenience sample of people with SCI (N=40), consisting of persons from the registry (n=30) and from the BCI study (n=10). Participants were classified as those with low function (n=24) and those with high function (n=16). Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Descriptive statistics of functional independence, living situations and support structures, ratings of importance of different task and design features, and acceptable levels of performance, risk, and time investment. Results BCIs were of interest to 96{\%} of the low-function group. Emergency communication was the top priority task (ranked in the top 2 by 43{\%}). The most important design features were "functions the BCI provides" and "simplicity of BCI setup." Desired performance was 90{\%} accuracy, with standby mode errors no more than once every 4 hours and speeds of more than 20 letters per minute. Dry electrodes were preferred over gel or implanted electrodes (P{\textless}.05). Median acceptable setup time was 10 to 20 minutes, satisfying 65{\%} of participants. Conclusions People with low functional independence resulting from SCI have a strong interest in BCIs. Advances in speed and setup time will be required for BCIs to meet the desired performance. Creating BCI functions appropriate to the needs of those with SCI will be of ultimate importance for BCI acceptance with this population.},

abstract = {Objective performance-based outcome measures (OMs) have the potential to provide unbiased and reproducible assessments of limb function. However, very few of these performance-based OMs have been validated for upper limb (UL) prosthesis users. OMs validated in other clinical populations (eg, neurologic or musculoskeletal conditions) could be used to fill gaps in existing performance-based OMs for UL amputees. Additionally, a joint review might reveal consistent gaps across multiple clinical populations. Therefore, the objective of this review was to systematically characterize prominent measures used in both sets of clinical populations with regard to (1) location of task performance around the body, (2) possible grips employed, (3) bilateral versus unilateral task participation, and (4) details of scoring mechanisms. A systematic literature search was conducted in EMBASE, Medline, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health electronic databases for variations of the following terms: stroke, musculoskeletal dysfunction, amputation, prosthesis, upper limb, outcome, assessments. Articles were included if they described performance-based OMs developed for disabilities of the UL. Results show most tasks were performed with 1 hand in the space directly in front of the participant. The tip, tripod, and cylindrical grips were most commonly used for the specific tasks. Few measures assessed sensation and movement quality. Overall, several limitations in OMs were identified. The solution to these limitations may be to modify and validate existing measures originally developed for other clinical populations as first steps to more aptly measure prosthesis use while more complete assessments for UL prosthesis users are being developed.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. APPROACH We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. MAIN RESULTS We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. SIGNIFICANCE This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in BCI.},

abstract = {Background People with chronic tetraplegia, due to high-cervical spinal cord injury, can regain limb movements through coordinated electrical stimulation of peripheral muscles and nerves, known as functional electrical stimulation (FES). Users typically command FES systems through other preserved, but unrelated and limited in number, volitional movements (eg, facial muscle activity, head movements, shoulder shrugs). We report the findings of an individual with traumatic high-cervical spinal cord injury who coordinated reaching and grasping movements using his own paralysed arm and hand, reanimated through implanted FES, and commanded using his own cortical signals through an intracortical brain–computer interface (iBCI). Methods We recruited a participant into the BrainGate2 clinical trial, an ongoing study that obtains safety information regarding an intracortical neural interface device, and investigates the feasibility of people with tetraplegia controlling assistive devices using their cortical signals. Surgical procedures were performed at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (Cleveland, OH, USA). Study procedures and data analyses were performed at Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH, USA) and the US Department of Veterans Affairs, Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Cleveland, OH, USA). The study participant was a 53-year-old man with a spinal cord injury (cervical level 4, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale category A). He received two intracortical microelectrode arrays in the hand area of his motor cortex, and 4 months and 9 months later received a total of 36 implanted percutaneous electrodes in his right upper and lower arm to electrically stimulate his hand, elbow, and shoulder muscles. The participant used a motorised mobile arm support for gravitational assistance and to provide humeral abduction and adduction under cortical control. We assessed the participant's ability to cortically command his paralysed arm to perform simple single-joint arm and hand movements and functionally meaningful multi-joint movements. We compared iBCI control of his paralysed arm with that of a virtual three-dimensional arm. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00912041. Findings The intracortical implant occurred on Dec 1, 2014, and we are continuing to study the participant. The last session included in this report was Nov 7, 2016. The point-to-point target acquisition sessions began on Oct 8, 2015 (311 days after implant). The participant successfully cortically commanded single-joint and coordinated multi-joint arm movements for point-to-point target acquisitions (80–100{\%} accuracy), using first a virtual arm and second his own arm animated by FES. Using his paralysed arm, the participant volitionally performed self-paced reaches to drink a mug of coffee (successfully completing 11 of 12 attempts within a single session 463 days after implant) and feed himself (717 days after implant). Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first report of a combined implanted FES+iBCI neuroprosthesis for restoring both reaching and grasping movements to people with chronic tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury, and represents a major advance, with a clear translational path, for clinically viable neuroprostheses for restoration of reaching and grasping after paralysis.

abstract = {Searching for target images in large volume imagery is a challenging problem and the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) triage is potentially a promising solution to the problem. RSVP triage is essentially a cortically-coupled computer vision technique that relies on single-trial detection of event-related potentials (ERP). In RSVP triage, images are shown to a subject in a rapid serial sequence. When a target image is seen by the subject, unique ERP characterized by P300 are elicited. Thus, in RSVP triage, accurate detection of such distinct ERP allows for fast searching of target images in large volume imagery. The accuracy of the distinct ERP detection in RSVP triage depends on the feature extraction method, for which the common spatial pattern analysis (CSP) was used with limited success. This paper presents a novel feature extraction method, termed common spatio-temporal pattern (CSTP), which is critical for robust single-trial detection of ERP. Unlike the conventional CSP, whereby only spatial patterns of ERP are considered, the present proposed method exploits spatial and temporal patterns of ERP separately, providing complementary spatial and temporal features for high accurate single-trial ERP detection. Numerical study using data collected from 20 subjects in RSVP triage experiments demonstrates that the proposed method offers significant performance improvement over the conventional CSP method (corrected p-value {\textless} 0.05, Pearson r = 0.64) and other competing methods in the literature. This paper further shows that the main idea of CSTP can be easily applied to other methods.},

abstract = {This paper is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the L1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},

People that cannot communicate due to neurological disorders would benefit from a system that can infer internal speech directly from brain signals. In this review article, we describe the state of the art in decoding inner speech, ranging from early acoustic sound features, to higher order speech units. We focused on intracranial recordings, as this technique allows monitoring brain activity with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, and therefore is a good candidate to investigate inner speech. Despite intense efforts, investigating how the human cortex encodes inner speech remains an elusive challenge, due to the lack of behavioral and observable measures. We emphasize various challenges commonly encountered when investigating inner speech, and propose potential solutions in order to get closer to a natural speech assistive device.},

In this study, we used a tactile P3-based BCI in 12 patients without behavioral command following, attempting to establish ‘covert command following'. These results were then confronted to cerebral metabolism preservation as measured with glucose PET (FDG-PET). One patient showed ‘covert command following' (i.e., above-threshold BCI performance) during the active tactile paradigm. This patient also showed a higher cerebral glucose metabolism within the language network (presumably required for command following) when compared with the other patients without ‘covert command-following' but having a cerebral glucose metabolism indicative of minimally conscious state. Our results suggest that the P3-based BCI might probe ‘covert command following' in patients without behavioral response to command and therefore could be a valuable addition in the clinical assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness.},

abstract = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has the prospects of helping stroke survivors by enabling the interaction with their environ ment through brain signals rather than through muscles, and restoring motor function by inducing activity-dependent brain plasticity. This paper presents a clinical study on the extent of detectable brain signals from a large population of stroke patients in using EEG-based motor imagery BCI. EEG data were collected from 54 stroke patients whereby finger tapping and motor imagery of the stroke-affected hand were performed by 8 and 46 patients, respectively. EEG data from 11 patients who gave further consent to perform motor imagery were also collected for second calibration and third independent test sessions conducted on separate days. Off-line accuracies of classifying the two classes of EEG from finger tapping or motor imagery of the stroke-affected hand versus the EEG from background rest were then assessed and compared to 16 healthy subjects. The mean off-line accuracy of detecting motor imagery by the 46 patients (mu=0.74) was significantly lower than finger tapping by 8 patients (mu=0.87, p=0.008), but not significantly lower than motor imagery by healthy subjects (mu=0.78, p=0.23). Six stroke patients performed motor imagery at chance level, and no correlation was found between the accuracies of detecting motor imagery and their motor impairment in terms of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (p=0.29). The off-line accuracies of the 11 patients in the second session (mu=0.76) were not significantly different from the first session (mu=0.72, p=0.16), or from the on-line accuracies of the third independent test session (mu=0.82, p=0.14). Hence this study showed that the majority of stroke patients could use EEG-based motor imagery BCI.},

Here we report a high-performance intracortical BCI (iBCI) for communication, which was tested by three clinical trial participants with paralysis. The system leveraged advances in decoder design developed in prior pre-clinical and clinical studies (Gilja et al., 2015; Kao et al., 2016; Gilja et al., 2012). For all three participants, performance exceeded previous iBCIs (Bacher et al., 2015; Jarosiewicz et al., 2015) as measured by typing rate (by a factor of 1.4–4.2) and information throughput (by a factor of 2.2–4.0).

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for communication have reached considerable technical maturity, there is still a great need for state-of-the-art evaluation by the end-users outside laboratory environments. To achieve this primary objective, it is necessary to augment a BCI with a series of components that allow end-users to type text effectively. APPROACH: This work presents the clinical evaluation of a motor imagery (MI) BCI text-speller, called BrainTree, by six severely disabled end-users and ten able-bodied users. Additionally, we define a generic model of code-based BCI applications, which serves as an analytical tool for evaluation and design. MAIN RESULTS: We show that all users achieved remarkable usability and efficiency outcomes in spelling. Furthermore, our model-based analysis highlights the added value of human-computer interaction techniques and hybrid BCI error-handling mechanisms, and reveals the effects of BCI performances on usability and efficiency in code-based applications. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the usability potential of code-based MI spellers, with BrainTree being the first to be evaluated by a substantial number of end-users, establishing them as a viable, competitive alternative to other popular BCI spellers. Another major outcome of our model-based analysis is the derivation of a 80{\%} minimum command accuracy requirement for successful code-based application control, revising upwards previous estimates attempted in the literature.},

Specific brain responseswere evoked by violating the operators' expectations to varying degrees. The evoked brain activity demonstrated detectable differences reflecting congruency with or deviations from the operators' expectations. Real-time analysis of this activity was used to build a user model of those expectations, thus representing the optimal (expected) state as perceived by the operator. Based on this model, which was continuously updated, the computer automatically adapted itself to the expectations of its operator. Further analyses showed this evoked activity to originate from themedial prefrontal cortex and to exhibit a linear correspondence to the degree of expectation violation. These findings extend our un- derstanding of human predictive coding and provide evidence that the information used to generate the user model is task-specific and reflects goal congruency. This paper demonstrates a form of interaction without any explicit input by the operator, enabling computer systems to become neuroadaptive, that is, to automatically adapt to specific aspects of their operator'smindset.Neuroadaptive technology significantlywidens the communication bottleneck and has the potential to fundamentally change the way we interact with technology.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Brain-computer interfaces can provide an input channel from humans to computers that depends only on brain activity, bypassing traditional means of communication and interaction. This input channel can be used to send explicit commands, but also to provide implicit input to the computer. As such, the computer can obtain information about its user that not only bypasses, but also goes beyond what can be communicated using traditional means. In this form, implicit input can potentially provide significant improvements to human-computer interaction.

These waveforms are chosen in order to best match the signal structures. Matching pursuits are general procedures to compute adaptive signal representations. With a dictionary of Gabor functions a matching pursuit defines an adaptive time-frequency transform. They derive a signal energy distribution in the time-frequency plane, which does not include interference terms, unlike Wigner and Cohen class distributions. A matching pursuit isolates the signal structures that are coherent with respect to a given dictionary. An application to pattern extraction from noisy signals is described. They compare a matching pursuit decomposition with a signal expansion over an optimized wavepacket orthonormal basis, selected with the algorithm of Coifman and Wickerhauser see (IEEE Trans.

abstract = {Systematic reviews provide clinical practice recommendations that are based on evaluation of primary evidence. When systematic reviews with the same aims have different conclusions, it is difficult to ascertain which review reported the most credible and robust findings. This study examined five systematic reviews that have investigated the effectiveness of Pilates exercise in people with chronic low back pain. A four-stage process was used to interpret findings of the reviews. This process included comparison of research questions, included primary studies, and the level and quality of evidence of systematic reviews. Two independent reviewers assessed the level of evidence and the methodological quality of systematic reviews, using the National Health and Medical Research Council hierarchy of evidence, and the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews respectively. Any disagreements were resolved by a third researcher. A high level of consensus was achieved between the reviewers. Conflicting findings were reported by the five systematic reviews regarding the effectiveness of Pilates in reducing pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. Authors of the systematic reviews included primary studies that did not match their questions in relation to treatment or population characteristics. A total of ten primary studies were identified across five systematic reviews. Only two of the primary studies were included in all of the reviews due to different inclusion criteria relating to publication date and status, definition of Pilates, and methodological quality. The level of evidence of reviews was low due to the methodological design of the primary studies. The methodological quality of reviews varied. Those which conducted a meta-analysis obtained higher scores. There is inconclusive evidence that Pilates is effective in reducing pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. This is due to the small number and poor methodological quality of primary studies. The Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews provides a useful method of appraising the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Individual item scores, however, should be examined in addition to total scores, so that significant methodological flaws of systematic reviews are not missed, and results are interpreted appropriately.

We study its performance in simulated data as well as in visual and auditory ERPs. For the simulated data, the method gives a significantly better reconstruction of the single-trial event-related responses in comparison with the original data and also in comparison with a reconstruction based on conventional Wiener filtering. Moreover, with wavelet denoising we obtain a significantly better estimation of the amplitudes and latencies of the simulated ERPs. For the real data, the method clearly improves the visualization of both visual and auditory single-trial ERPs. This allows the calculation of better averages as well as the study of systematic or unsystematic variations between trials. Since the method is fast and parameter free, it could complement the conventional analysis of ERPs. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Automatic recognition of epileptic discharges has great significance in diagnosis of epilepsy. New method This paper proposes a novel automatic recognition of epileptic waves method in EEG signals based on shape similarity in time-series sequence directly. Merger of the increasing and decreasing sequences (MIDS) was used to improve the recognition accuracy and reduce the computation cost. Then shape templates were designed, and the modified Hausdorff distance was employed to measure the shape similarity of waveforms in template matching part. This approach imitates human visual cognitive process to analyze EEG and employs image recognition method into one-dimensional signals, which is a direct, original and effective method. Results 373 epileptic discharge fragments marked by clinicians from 20 patients' EEG recordings were selected. By fusing significance rules, 98.39{\%} of them were recognized, with the false recognition rate 1.1{\%}. Comparison with existing methods Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach yielded better performance for interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDS) recognition compared with the previous methods. Conclusions The proposed approach has good performance and high stability in automatic recognition of epileptic discharges both in ictal and interictal period, which could support the diagnosis of epilepsy greatly.},

Firstly, increasing and decreasing sequences as well as complete and incomplete waves are reviewed to highlight the characteristics of clinical visual detection of IED. The sequence merging rules and algorithms are consequently proposed for time-domain electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance MIDS detection on rhythm waves and slow waves are very close to clinical visual detection. Secondly, the MIDS detection method is applied to IED fragments according to IED features in the time-domain. The results show that most IED fragments are recognized, although with some false detection of non-IED fragments. To reduce such false detection rate, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was applied with 17 characteristics and a training over 232 fragments from 3 patients' EEG recordings. With the SVM improvement, out-of-sample clinical EEG recordings of 32 suspected epilepsy patients were analyzed and 95.9{\%} of the IED fragments marked by clinicians were successfully detected. The results show that the proposed algorithm performs well in IED detection and is a promising candidate in assisting clinicians' epilepsy diagnosis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The history of quantitative, computerized electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is reviewed. It is shown that, until very recently, the basic approach to EEG analysis involved the assumption that the EEG is stochastic. Consequently, statistical pattern recognition techniques, segmentation procedures, syntactic methods, knowledge-based approaches, and even artificial neural network methods have been developed with different levels of success. A fundamentally different approach to computerized EEG analysis, however, is making its way into the laboratories. The basic idea, inspired by recent advances in the area of non-linear dynamics, and especially the theory of chaos, is to view an EEG as the output of a deterministic system of relatively simple complexity, but containing non-linearities. This suggests that studying the geometrical dynamics of EEGs, and the development of neurophysiologically realistic models of EEG generation may produce more successful automated EEG analysis techniques than the classical, stochastic methods. Evidence supporting the non-linear dynamics paradigm is reviewed, and possible research paths are indicated. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Background and objective According to the World Health Organization (WHO) epilepsy affects approximately 45–50 million people. Electroencephalogram (EEG) records the neurological activity in the brain and it is used to identify epilepsy. Visual inspection of EEG signals is a time-consuming process and it may lead to human error. Feature extraction and classification are two main steps that are required to build an automated epilepsy detection framework. Feature extraction reduces the dimensions of the input signal by retaining informative features and the classifier assigns a proper class label to the extracted feature vector. Our aim is to present effective feature extraction techniques for automated epileptic EEG signal classification. Methods In this study, two effective feature extraction techniques (Local Neighbor Descriptive Pattern [LNDP] and One-dimensional Local Gradient Pattern [1D-LGP]) have been introduced to classify epileptic EEG signals. The classification between epileptic seizure and non-seizure signals is performed using different machine learning classifiers. The benchmark epilepsy EEG dataset provided by the University of Bonn is used in this research. The classification performance is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. The classifiers used are the Nearest Neighbor (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experiments have been repeated for 50 times. Results LNDP and 1D-LGP feature extraction techniques with ANN classifier achieved the average classification accuracy of 99.82{\%} and 99.80{\%}, respectively, for the classification between normal and epileptic EEG signals. Eight different experimental cases were tested. The classification results were better than those of some existing methods. Conclusions This study suggests that LNDP and 1D-LGP could be effective feature extraction techniques for the classification of epileptic EEG signals.},

abstract = {Zero-cross and zero-derivative period amplitude analysis (PAA) data were compared with power spectral analysis (PSA) data obtained with the fast Fourier transform in all-night sleep EEG from 10 subjects. Although PAA zero-cross-integrated amplitude showed good agreement with PSA power in 0.3-2 Hz, zero-cross analysis appears relatively ineffective in measuring 2-4 Hz and above waves. However, PAA zero-derivative measures of peak-trough amplitude correlated well with PSA power in 2-4 Hz. Thus, while PAA appears able to measure the entire EEG spectrum, the analytic technique should be changed from zero cross to zero derivative at about 2 Hz in human sleep EEG. PAA and PSA both demonstrate robust and interrelated across-night oscillations in three frequency bands: delta (0.3-4 Hz); sigma (12-16 Hz); and fast beta (20-40 Hz). The frequencies between delta and sigma, and between sigma and fast beta, did not show clear across-night oscillations using either method, and the two methods showed lower epoch-to-epoch agreement in these intermediate bands. The causes of this reduced agreement are not immediately clear, nor is it obvious which method gives more valid results. We believe that the three strongly oscillating frequency bands represent fundamental properties of the human sleep EEG that provide important clues to underlying physiological mechanisms. These mechanisms are more likely to be understood if their dynamic properties are preserved and measured naturalistically rather than being forced into arbitrary sleep stages or procrustean models. Both PAA and PSA can be employed for such naturalistic studies. PSA has the advantages of applying the same analytic method across the EEG spectrum and rests on more fully developed theory. Combined zero-cross and zero-derivative PAA demonstrates EEG oscillations that closely parallel those observed with spectral power, and the PAA measures do not rely on assumptions about the spectral composition of the signal. In addition, both PAA techniques can measure the relative contributions of wave amplitude and incidence to total power. These waveform characteristics represent different biological processes and respond differentially to a wide range of experimental conditions. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {The rate at which the world's population ages is important to policymakers, especially those dealing with pensions and healthcare. In particular, it is vital to anticipate periods of rapid change, when adjustments will be the most difficult. A new estimate of ageing trends in the global population combines traditional measures, based on a fixed age boundary, with new concepts of age. New concepts include a fixed remaining life expectancy, as today's 60 year old is 'younger' than a 60 year old from 1900 and has more years left to live. No matter how you look at it, the estimates are that the world's population is ageing with increasing speed. Global ageing is likely to peak between 2020 and 2030, and then decelerate, although there will be further increases in the level of ageing throughout the century. The timing of 'peak ageing' is based on past patterns of fertility. In the United States and in parts of Western Europe the 'baby boomers' are a big factor. In China, the timing of fertility control policies has a big influence.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study is to identify specific clinical-electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns at seizure onset in patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Methods: Sixty-six ictal video-EEG recordings corresponding to 26 patients with HS have been reviewed, focusing on the EEG features found during the first 30 ictal s. The EEG activity has been classified into the following groups: (A) according to spatial distribution: type 1: temporal electrodes on one side; type 2: temporal and adjacent frontal electrodes on one side; and type 3: non-lateralizing electrographic activity; and (B) according to morphology; subtype (a): regular 5-9 Hz rhythmic activity (RA); subtype (b): low-voltage rapid activity, followed by a 5-9 Hz RA; and subtype (c): irregular EEG sharp waves. We analyzed the clinical symptoms sequence and established the relationship with the ictal EEG patterns. Results: Considering spatial distribution and morphology, the most frequent ictal EEG patterns were type 1 (57{\%}), type 2 (37{\%}), and subtype (a): 62{\%}; subtype (b): 27{\%}; and subtype (c): 11{\%}. The sequence of clinical symptoms observed was: aura→behavioral arrest→oro-alimentary automatisms→unilateral hand automatisms. All seizures with aura and including two or more symptoms of the clinical sequence (65{\%}) were associated with a 1a, 1b, 2a or 2b EEG pattern. Conclusions: The identification of a specific clinical-EEG pattern provides a useful tool for the epileptogenic zone localization in non-invasive pre-surgical assessment of patients with hippocampal sclerosis. Significance: The identification of a specific clinical-EEG pattern associated to neuroimaging findings and neuropsychological testing allows indicating surgery for the treatment of epilepsy in patients with hippocampal sclerosis, without performing any further complementary studies. {\textcopyright} 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The recent advances have inspired world-wide enthusiasm resulting in billions of dollars invested in federal and industrial sponsorships to understanding the brain for rehabilitative applications. Additionally, private philanthropists have also demonstrated excitement in the field by investing in the use of brain interfacing technologies as a means to human augmentation. While the promise of incredible technologies is real, caution must be taken as implications regarding optimal performance and unforeseen side effects following device implantation into the brain are not fully characterized. The current study is aimed to quantify any motor deficit caused by microelectrode implantation in the motor cortex of healthy rats compared to non-implanted controls. Following electrode insertion, rats were tested on an open-field grid test to study gross motor function and a ladder test to study fine motor function. It was discovered that rats with chronically indwelling intracortical microelectrodes exhibited up to an incredible 527{\%} increase in time to complete the fine motor task. This initial study defines the need for further and more robust behavioral testing of potential unintentional harm caused by microelectrode implantation.},

Fujimori's method has been considered one of the most appropriate waveform analyses for EEG. This kind of analysis is advantageous for measuring frequency and amplitude of each EEG wave separately. However, current implementations have drawbacks which must be resolved before they can be used on all-night sleep EEG. An optimal sampling rate should be determined which is appropriate to the purpose of analysis. Amplitude thresholds for wave recognition, which are now set arbitrarily, should also be improved. Measurement of waves in higher orders of superimposition is also necessary, although existing systems are limited to the second order. Additional algorithms, such as for the separate detection of sleep slow waves, may be useful. Further applications for Fujimori's method are suggested.},

abstract = {Question of the study The reliable evaluation of polysomnographic recordings (PSG) is an essential precondition for good clinical practice in sleep medicine. Although the scoring rules of Rechtschaffen and Kales [86] are internationally well established, they leave some room for different interpretations, and this may contribute to the limited reliability of visual sleep scoring. The German Sleep Society (DGSM) has set up a task force to devise ways to improve scoring reliability in the framework of their quality management programme. The intention was not to revise the rules of Rechtschaffen and Kales (R{\&}K), but to facilitate their reliable application in sleep scoring and to support the development of standardized algorithms for computerized sleep analysis. Methods The task force was formed in September 2004 as a subcommittee of the educational panel of the DGSM. The members of the task force are experienced in sleep scoring and have a background either in physiology, neurology, psychiatry, psychology, or biology. The aim of the task force was to provide interpretation aids and, if needed, specifications or amendments to the R{\&}K rules for the scoring of sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms and patterns. Decisions were based on the nominal group technique of a nominal panel as the formal consensus-building process. The consensus process was based on scoring and face-to-face discussions of at least 40 examples for each pattern in four 2-day meetings. Results Relevant EEG patterns for sleep stage scoring are alpha, theta, and delta waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes, vertex sharp waves, and sawtooth waves. If definitions for a given EEG pattern differed in the literature, the nominal group technique resulted in specifications and amended scoring rules for these EEG patterns. A second part including a series of examples with explanatory comments for each of these EEG patterns is under preparation. Conclusions Amendatory scoring rules of those EEG patterns that are relevant for sleep scoring may contribute to increasing the reliability of visual sleep scoring and to support the development of standardized algorithms for computerized sleep analysis.

abstract = {entropy, complexity measure, information processing, fractal dimension applications I Abstract Quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) plays a significant role in EEG-based clinical diagnosis and studies of brain function. In past decades, various qEEG methods have been extensively studied. This article provides a detailed review of the advances in this field. qEEG methods are generally classified into linear and nonlinear approaches. The traditional qEEG approach is based on spectrum analysis, which hypothesizes that the EEG is a stationary process. EEG signals are nonstationary and nonlinear, especially in some pathological conditions. Various time-frequency representations and time-dependent measures have been proposed to address those transient and irregular events in EEG. With regard to the nonlinearity of EEG, higher order statistics and chaotic measures have been put forward. In characterizing the interactions across the cerebral cortex, an information theory-based measure such as mutual information is applied. To improve the spatial resolution, qEEG analysis has also been combined with medical imaging technology (e.g., CT, MR, and PET). With these advances, qEEG plays a very important role in basic research and clinical studies of brain injury, neurological disorders, epilepsy, sleep studies and consciousness, and brain function.},

With MEG being more sensitive to neural activity from tangential currents and EEG being able to detect both radial and tangential sources, the two methods are complementary. Over the years, neurophysiological studies have changed considerably: high-density recordings are becoming de rigueur; there is interest in both spontaneous and evoked activity; and sophisticated artifact detection and removal methods are available. Improved head models for source estimation have also increased the precision of the current estimates, particularly for EEG and combined EEG/MEG. Because of their complementarity, more investigators are beginning to perform simultaneous EEG/MEG studies to gain more complete information about neural activity. Given the increase in methodological complexity in EEG/MEG, it is important to gather data that are of high quality and that are as artifact free as possible. Here, we discuss some issues in data acquisition and analysis of EEG and MEG data. Practical considerations for different types of EEG and MEG studies are also discussed.},

Moreover, the method is capable of setting amplitude thresholds for spike detection.

abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) acquire brain signals, analyze them, and translate them into commands that are relayed to output devices that carry out desired actions. BCIs do not use normal neuromuscular output pathways. The main goal of BCI is to replace or restore useful function to people disabled by neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebral palsy, stroke, or spinal cord injury. From initial demonstrations of electroencephalography- based spelling and single-neuron-based device control, researchers have gone on to use electroencephalographic, intracortical, electrocorticographic, and other brain signals for increasingly complex control of cursors, robotic arms, prostheses, wheelchairs, and other devices. Brain-computer interfaces may also prove useful for rehabilitation after stroke and for other disorders. In the future, they might augment the performance of surgeons or other medical professionals. Brain-computer interface technology is the focus of a rapidly growing research and development enterprise that is greatly exciting scientists, engineers, clinicians, and the public in general. Its future achievements will depend on advances in 3 crucial areas. Brain-computer interfaces need signal-acquisition hardware that is convenient, portable, safe, and able to function in all environments. Brain-computer interface systems need to be validated in long-term studies of real-world use by people with severe disabilities, and effective and viable models for their widespread dissemination must be implemented. Finally, the day-to-day and moment-to-moment reliability of BCI performance must be improved so that it approaches the reliability of natural muscle-based function. {\textcopyright} 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.},

abstract = {A highly comparative, feature-based approach to time series classification is introduced that uses an extensive database of algorithms to extract thousands of interpretable features from time series. These features are derived from across the scientific time-series analysis literature, and include summaries of time series in terms of their correlation structure, distribution, entropy, stationarity, scaling properties, and fits to a range of time-series models. After computing thousands of features for each time series in a training set, those that are most informative of the class structure are selected using greedy forward feature selection with a linear classifier. The resulting feature-based classifiers automatically learn the differences between classes using a reduced number of time-series properties, and circumvent the need to calculate distances between time series. Representing time series in this way results in orders of magnitude of dimensionality reduction, allowing the method to perform well on very large datasets containing long time series or time series of different lengths. For many of the datasets studied, classification performance exceeded that of conventional instance-based classifiers, including one nearest neighbor classifiers using Euclidean distances and dynamic time warping and, most importantly, the features selected provide an understanding of the properties of the dataset, insight that can guide further scientific investigation.},

@article{Nevado-Holgado2012,
abstract = {In this paper we propose that the dynamic evolution of EEG activity during epileptic seizures may be characterised as a path through parameter space of a neural mass model, reflecting gradual changes in underlying physiological mechanisms. Previous theoretical studies have shown how boundaries in parameter space of the model (so-called bifurcations) correspond to transitions in EEG waveforms between apparently normal, spike and wave and subsequently poly-spike and wave activity. In the present manuscript, we develop a multi-objective genetic algorithm that can estimate parameters of an underlying model from clinical data recordings. A standard approach to this problem is to transform both clinical data and model output into the frequency domain and then choose parameters that minimise the difference in their respective power spectra. Instead in the present manuscript, we estimate parameters in the time domain, their choice being determined according to the best fit obtained between the model output and specific features of the observed EEG waveform. This results in an approximate path through the bifurcation plane of the model obtained from clinical data. We present comparisons of such paths through parameter space from separate seizures from an individual subject, as well as between different subjects. Differences in the path reflect subtleties of variation in the dynamics of EEG, which at present appear indistinguishable using standard clinical techniques. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Epilepsy is an electrophysiological disorder of the brain, characterized by recurrent seizures. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures and records the electrical activity of the brain, and is widely used in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However, it is often difficult to identify subtle but critical changes in the EEG waveform by visual inspection, thus opening up a vast research area for biomedical engineers to develop and implement several intelligent algorithms for the identification of such subtle changes. Moreover, the EEG signals are nonlinear and non-stationary in nature, which contribute to further complexities related to their manual interpretation and detection of normal and abnormal (interictal and ictal) activities. Hence, it is necessary to develop a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system to automatically identify the normal and abnormal activities using minimum number of highly discriminating features in classifiers. It has been found that nonlinear features are able to capture the complex physiological phenomena such as abrupt transitions and chaotic behavior in the EEG signals. In this review, we discuss various feature extraction methods and the results of different automated epilepsy stage detection techniques in detail. We also briefly present the various open ended challenges that need to be addressed before a CAD based epilepsy detection system can be set-up in a clinical setting. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A BCI system goes through many phases including preprocessing, feature extraction, signal classifications, and finally control. Large body of research are found at each phase and this might confuse researchers and BCI developers. This article is a review to the state-of-the-art work in the field of BCI. The main focus of this review is on the Brain control signals, their types and classifications. In addition, this survey reviews the current BCI technology in terms of hardware and software where the most used BCI devices are described as well as the most utilized software platforms are explained. Finally, BCI challenges and future directions are stated. Due to the limited space and large body of literature in the field of BCI, another two review articles are planned. One of these articles reviews the up-to-date BCI algorithms and techniques for signal processing, feature extraction, signals classification, and control. Another article will be dedicated to BCI systems and applications. The three articles are written as base and guidelines for researchers and developers pursue the work in the field of BCI.},

abstract = {Objective: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) aimed at restoring communication to people with severe neuromuscular disabilities often use event-related potentials (ERPs) in scalp-recorded EEG activity. Up to the present, most research and development in this area has been done in the laboratory with young healthy control subjects. In order to facilitate the development of BCI most useful to people with disabilities, the present study set out to: (1) determine whether people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and healthy, age-matched volunteers (HVs) differ in the speed and accuracy of their ERP-based BCI use; (2) compare the ERP characteristics of these two groups; and (3) identify ERP-related factors that might enable improvement in BCI performance for people with disabilities. Methods: Sixteen EEG channels were recorded while people with ALS or healthy age-matched volunteers (HVs) used a P300-based BCI. The subjects with ALS had little or no remaining useful motor control (mean ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised 9.4 (±9.5SD) (range 0-25)). Each subject attended to a target item as the items in a 6. ×. 6 visual matrix flashed. The BCI used a stepwise linear discriminant function (SWLDA) to determine the item the user wished to select (i.e., the target item). Offline analyses assessed the latencies, amplitudes, and locations of ERPs to the target and non-target items for people with ALS and age-matched control subjects. Results: BCI accuracy and communication rate did not differ significantly between ALS users and HVs. Although ERP morphology was similar for the two groups, their target ERPs differed significantly in the location and amplitude of the late positivity (P300), the amplitude of the early negativity (N200), and the latency of the late negativity (LN). Conclusions: The differences in target ERP components between people with ALS and age-matched HVs are consistent with the growing recognition that ALS may affect cortical function. The development of BCIs for use by this population may begin with studies in HVs but also needs to include studies in people with ALS. Their differences in ERP components may affect the selection of electrode montages, and might also affect the selection of presentation parameters (e.g., matrix design, stimulation rate). Significance: P300-based BCI performance in people severely disabled by ALS is similar to that of age-matched control subjects. At the same time, their ERP components differ to some degree from those of controls. Attention to these differences could contribute to the development of BCIs useful to those with ALS and possibly to others with severe neuromuscular disabilities.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to benchmarking brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) outside the lab. A computer game was created that mimics a real-world application of assistive BCIs, with the main outcome metric being the time needed to complete the game. This approach was used at the Cybathlon 2016, a competition for people with disabilities who use assistive technology to achieve tasks. The paper summarizes the technical challenges of BCIs, describes the design of the benchmarking game, then describes the rules for acceptable hardware, software and inclusion of human pilots in the BCI competition at the Cybathlon. The 11 participating teams, their approaches, and their results at the Cybathlon are presented. Though the benchmarking procedure has some limitations (for instance, we were unable to identify any factors that clearly contribute to BCI performance), it can be successfully used to analyze BCI performance in realistic, less structured conditions. In the future, the parameters of the benchmarking game could be modified to better mimic different applications (e.g. the need to use some commands more frequently than others). Furthermore, the Cybathlon has the potential to showcase such devices to the general public.},

Multiple factors that inhibit the achievement of this goal have already been identified. However, it is not clear how they affect the overall BCI performance or how they should be tackled. This is worsened by publication bias, where only positive results are disseminated, preventing the research community from learning from its errors. This paper is the result of a workshop held at the 6th International BCI meeting in Asilomar. We summarize here the discussion on concrete research aven...},

abstract = {In this study, we propose a novel method to investigate P300 variability over different trials. The method incorporates spatial correlation between EEG channels to form a cooperative coupled particle filtering method that tracks the P300 subcomponents, P3a and P3b, over trials. Using state space systems, the amplitude, latency, and width of each subcomponent are modeled as the main underlying parameters. With four electrodes, two coupled Rao-Blackwellised particle filter pairs are used to recursively estimate the system state over trials. A number of physiological constraints are also imposed to avoid generating invalid particles in the estimation process. Motivated by the bilateral symmetry of ERPs over the brain, the channels further share their estimates with their neighbors and combine the received information to obtain a more accurate and robust solution. The proposed algorithm is capable of estimating the P300 subcomponents in single trials and outperforms its non-cooperative counterpart.},

The neuropsychological origins of the P3a and P3b subcomponents are detailed, and how target/standard discrimination difficulty modulates scalp topography is discussed. The neural loci of P3a and P3b generation are outlined, and a cognitive model is proffered: P3a originates from stimulus-driven frontal attention mechanisms during task processing, whereas P3b originates from temporal-parietal activity associated with attention and appears related to subsequent memory processing. Neurotransmitter actions associating P3a to frontal/dopaminergic and P3b to parietal/norepinephrine pathways are highlighted. Neuroinhibition is suggested as an overarching theoretical mechanism for P300, which is elicited when stimulus detection engages memory operations. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

Aiming at the fault feature of rolling bearing, a novel double-dictionary matching pursuit (DDMP) for fault extent evaluation of rolling bearing based on the Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) index is proposed in this paper. In order to match the features of rolling bearing fault, the impulse time-frequency dictionary and modulation dictionary are constructed to form the double-dictionary by using the method of parameterized function model. Then a novel matching pursuit method is proposed based on the new double-dictionary. For rolling bearing vibration signals with different fault sizes, the signals are decomposed and reconstructed by the DDMP. After the noise reduced and signals reconstructed, the LZC index is introduced to realize the fault extent evaluation. The applications of this method to the fault experimental signals of bearing outer race and inner race with different degree of injury have shown that the proposed method can effectively realize the fault extent evaluation.},

abstract = {Population ageing is now recognised as a global issue of increasing importance, and has many implications for health care and other areas of social policy. However, these issues remain relatively under-researched, particularly in poorer countries, and there is a dearth of specific policy initiatives at the international level. For example, the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development agreed to 15 key principles for future policy, but none of these even make indirect mention of the aged (International Conference on Population and Development, 1995, Documents. Programme of action of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development. Population and Development Review, 21(2), 437-461). This paper seeks to highlight some of the key issues arising from population ageing. It begins with a brief overview of international trends in demographic ageing, and considers the health needs of different groups of older people. It sketches out some implications for policy, paying particular attention to the financing and organisation of health services. The final part of the paper contains a discussion about how older people have been affected by, and have adapted to, processes of social, economic and political change. Given the wide scope of these concerns, it is not possible to discuss any issue in detail, and the paper does not claim to give the subject matter a comprehensive or global treatment. It must be stressed that patterns of ageing and their implications for policy are highly complex and variable, and, as such, great care should be taken in generalising between the experiences of different groups of older people, and between different settings.

CAN-BIND is a multi-site, multi-investigator, and multi-project network supported by the Ontario Brain Institute with access to Brain-CODE, an informatics platform that hosts a multitude of biological data across a growing list of brain pathologies. We describe our approaches and insights on documenting and standardizing parameters across the study design, data collection, monitoring, analysis, integration, knowledge-translation, and data archiving phases of CAN-BIND projects. We introduce a custom-built EEG toolbox to track data preprocessing with open-access for the scientific community. We also evaluate the impact of variation in equipment setup on the accuracy of acquired data.

abstract = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a hardware and software communications system that permits cerebral activity alone to control computers or external devices. The immediate goal of BCI research is to provide communications capabilities to severely disabled people who are totally paralyzed or 'locked in' by neurological neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brain stem stroke, or spinal cord injury. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of BCIs, looking at the different steps that form a standard BCI: signal acquisition, preprocessing or signal enhancement, feature extraction, classification and the control interface. We discuss their advantages, drawbacks, and latest advances, and we survey the numerous technologies reported in the scientific literature to design each step of a BCI. First, the review examines the neuroimaging modalities used in the signal acquisition step, each of which monitors a different functional brain activity such as electrical, magnetic or metabolic activity. Second, the review discusses different electrophysiological control signals that determine user intentions, which can be detected in brain activity. Third, the review includes some techniques used in the signal enhancement step to deal with the artifacts in the control signals and improve the performance. Fourth, the review studies some mathematic algorithms used in the feature extraction and classification steps which translate the information in the control signals into commands that operate a computer or other device. Finally, the review provides an overview of various BCI applications that control a range of devices.},

abstract = {An automatic analyser which characterizes, as well as detects, seismic phases can be a significant help in the interpretation of seismograms. Such an analyser has been constructed using concepts from work in artificial intelligence. A seismogram is recognized as a hierarchical structure of subunits and the features characterizing a phase are extracted via a structural analysis. The automatic analyser detects the onsets of phases, separates the relevant waveform segments, fits phase structures to standard wavelets, and generates a set of five parameters ( a quintuple') to characterize a detected phase. The whole analysis system requires just a few input parameters and can be accomplished swiftly enough to allow continuous real-time operation. The analysis procedure is adaptive, including updating of the estimate of the local frequency so that it can be applied to broad-band records with a wide range of frequency content. By coupling the analysis procedure with real-time filtering, very good results for phase detection and characterization can be achieved for weak distant events. The characterization of phase segments also provides useful information for the comparison of seismograms.},

abstract = {Patterns of neural data obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) can be classified by machine learning techniques to increase human-system performance. In controlled laboratory settings this classification approach works well; however, transitioning these approaches into more dynamic, unconstrained environments will present several significant challenges. One such challenge is an increase in temporal variability in measured behavioral and neural responses, which often results in suboptimal classification performance. Previously, we reported a novel classification method designed to account for temporal variability in the neural response in order to improve classification performance by using sliding windows in hierarchical discriminant component analysis (HDCA), and demonstrated a decrease in classification error by over 50{\%} when compared to the standard HDCA method (Marathe et al., 2013). Here, we expand upon this approach and show that embedded within this new method is a novel signal transformation that, when applied to EEG signals, significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio and thereby enables more accurate single-trial analysis. The results presented here have significant implications for both brain-computer interaction technologies and basic science research into neural processes.},

In this article we propose a new method to reliably estimate single-trial amplitude and latency of EEG/MEG signals. The advantages of the method are fourfold. First, no a-priori specified template function is required. Second, the method allows for multiple signals that may vary independently in amplitude and/or latency. Third, the method is less sensitive to noise as it models data with a parsimonious set of basis functions. Finally, the method is very fast since it is based on an iterative linear least squares algorithm. A simulation study shows that the method yields reliable estimates under different levels of latency variation and signal-to-noise ratio{\~{O}}s. Furthermore, it shows that the existence of multiple signals can be correctly determined. An application to empirical data from a choice reaction time study indicates that the method describes these data accurately.},

abstract = {Objective: Designing a reliable and accurate brain-computer interface (BCI) is one of the most challenging fields in biomedical signal processing. To achieve this goal, different methods have been adopted in different blocks of a typical BCI system (i.e., in preprocessing, feature extraction, feature classification and feature selection blocks). Since BCI's speed plays a crucial role in its success in real-life applications, using mathematically simple techniques with accurate and reliable performance can improve this aspect of BCI systems' design. Methods and materials: In this paper, a new method is introduced, which combines information from different classic time series similarity measures, using a simple fuzzy fusion framework. This method is accurate and reliable in P300 (a positive event-related component occurring 300 ms after stimulus onset) detection. This framework is used to combine two computationally simple signal detection methods: "peak picking" and "template matching". Fusion takes place in the last step (decision-making step) by means of a fuzzy rule-base. Results and conclusions: Compared to similar works on electroencephalogram-based (EEG-based) BCI datasets, in spite of being computationally simple, this new technique's performance is comparable to very complicated methods, like support vector machines. This research indicates that, using both spatial and temporal information content of EEG trials (from all electrodes or a subset of them), even under a non-complicated mathematical framework can yield an accurate and powerful classification. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases and the most common neurological chronic disease in childhood. Electroencephalography (EEG) still remains one of the most useful and effective tools in understanding and treatment of epilepsy. To this end, many computational methods have been devel-oped for both the detection and prediction of epileptic seizures. Techniques derived from linear/nonlinear analysis, chaos, information theory, morphological analysis, model-based analysis, all present different advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. Recently, there is the notion of selecting and combining the most robust features from different methods for revealing various signals' characteristics and making more reliable assumptions. Finally, intelligent classifiers are employed in order to distinguish epileptic state out of normal states. This chapter reviews the most widely adopted algorithms for the detection and prediction of epileptic seizures, emphasizing on information theory based and entropy indices. Each method's accuracy has been evaluated through performance measures, assessing the ability of automatic seizure detection/ prediction.},

Using pseudo-real simulations of auditory oddball data, we wanted to know whether this finding also held true for the P3 complex. The performance of three methods was studied: peak picking, Woody's method, and Pham et al.'s method (as well as an extension of this latter method). Performance of all methods critically depended on the signal-to-noise ratio. There was some advantage for the more sophisticated methods, particularly when signal-to-noise ratios were realistic. "Good" trials may be selected by all methods, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, but this selection entails the risk of bias. Further research should investigate whether these conclusions also hold true when the P3 complex consists of more than one component.},

abstract = {The intra-subject variability (ISV) in brain responses during cognitive processing across experimental trials has been recognised as an important facet of neural functionality reflecting an intrinsic neurophysiological characteristic of the brain. In recent decades, ISV in behaviour has been found to be significantly associated with cognitive functioning varying across individuals, development, ages, and pathological conditions. Event-related potentials (ERPs) measured in single trials are important tools for characterizing ISV at the neural level. However, due to the overlapping spectra of noise and signals, the retrieval of information from single-trial ERPs related to cognitive processing has been a challenge. We review the major problems that researchers face in the estimation of ISV in single-trial ERPs. Then, we present an extensive evaluation of several methods of single-trial latency estimation based on both simulated and real data. The relationships of ISV in ERPs and reaction times are compared between the different single-trial methods to assess their relative efficiency in predicting task performance from neural signals. The pros and cons of the methods are discussed.},

abstract = {Signals recorded from the brain often show rhythmic patterns at different frequencies, which are tightly coupled to the external stimuli as well as the internal state of the subject. In addition, these signals have very transient structures related to spiking or sudden onset of a stimulus, which have durations not exceeding tens of milliseconds. Further, brain signals are highly nonstationary because both behavioral state and external stimuli can change on a short time scale. It is therefore essential to study brain signals using techniques that can represent both rhythmic and transient components of the signal, something not always possible using standard signal processing techniques such as short time fourier transform, multitaper method, wavelet transform, or Hilbert transform. In this review, we describe a multiscale decomposition technique based on an over-complete dictionary called matching pursuit (MP), and show that it is able to capture both a sharp stimulus-onset transient and a sustained gamma rhythm in local field potential recorded from the primary visual cortex. We compare the performance of MP with other techniques and discuss its advantages and limitations. Data and codes for generating all time-frequency power spectra are provided.},

abstract = {Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) are important research tools because they provide insights into mental processing at high temporal resolution. Their usefulness, however, is limited by the need to average over a large number of trials, sacrificing information about the trial-by-trial variability of latencies or amplitudes of specific ERP components. Here we propose a novel method based on an iteration strategy of the residues of averaged ERPs (RIDE) to separate latency-variable component clusters. The separated component clusters can then serve as templates to estimate latencies in single trials with high precision. By applying RIDE to data from a face-priming experiment, we separate priming effects and show that they are robust against latency shifts and within-condition variability. RIDE is useful for a variety of data sets that show different degrees of variability and temporal overlap between ERP components.},

abstract = {We present a new paradigm for the adaptive estimation of evoked brain responses in single trials, based upon the combination of the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm and template matching, and referred to as Template Matching Pursuit (TMP). In contrast to the classical template matching with invariant single-trial morphology and to previous approaches using MP with strong similarity constraint on functions in sequential trials, this adaptive approach allows for a wide variety of waveforms, and its universality is retained by parametrizing all relevant waveforms in terms of Gabor functions. A survey of single-trial estimates obtained for 10 subjects (???4000 individual trials in total) confirms the validity of the assumption of a good approximation of single-trial waveforms. Owing to the fully parametric approach, we can easily perform also any quantitative analysis of such a huge dataset. As an example we take the trial-to-trial variability of the peak amplitude and latency of the auditory M100 component. This methodology provides estimates of diversified morphologies, which makes it free from the limitations inherent to any restrictive model. This seems advantageous in the context of the ongoing debate as to the neural mechanisms of average evoked brain responses. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

By relative, we refer to the fact that this new measure is highly dependent on the decomposition dictionary used by MP. The structural part of the definition points to the fact that this new measure is related to the structure, or composition, of the signal under analysis. After a formal definition, the proposed RSC measure is used in the analysis of newborn electroencephalogram (EEG). To do this, firstly, a time-frequency decomposition dictionary is specifically designed to compactly represent the newborn EEG seizure state using MP. We then show, through the analysis of synthetic and real newborn EEG data, that the relative structural complexity measure can indicate changes in EEG structure as it transitions between the two EEG states; namely seizure and background (non-seizure).},

abstract = {Brief radiant laser pulses can be used to activate cutaneous A?? and C nociceptors selectively and elicit a number of transient brain responses in the ongoing EEG (N1, N2 and P2 waves of laser-evoked brain potentials, LEPs). Despite its physiological and clinical relevance, the early-latency N1 wave of LEPs is often difficult to measure reliably, because of its small signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus producing unavoidable biases in the interpretation of the results. Here, we aimed to develop a method to enhance the SNR of the N1 wave and measure its peak latency and amplitude in both average and single-trial waveforms. We obtained four main findings. First, we suggest that the N1 wave can be better detected using a central-frontal montage (Cc-Fz), as compared to the recommended temporal-frontal montage (Tc-Fz). Second, we show that the N1 wave is optimally detected when the neural activities underlying the N2 wave, which interfere with the scalp expression of the N1 wave, are preliminary isolated and removed using independent component analysis (ICA). Third, we show that after these N2-related activities are removed, the SNR of the N1 wave can be further enhanced using a novel approach based on wavelet filtering. Fourth, we provide quantitative evidence that a multiple linear regression approach can be applied to these filtered waveforms to obtain an automatic, reliable and unbiased estimate of the peak latency and amplitude of the N1 wave, both in average and single-trial waveforms. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper describes the development and testing of a system whereby one can communicate through a computer by using the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP). Such a system may be used as a communication aid by individuals who cannot use any motor system for communication (e.g., 'locked-in' patients). The 26 letters of the alphabet, together with several other symbols and commands, are displayed on a computer screen which serves as the keyboard or prosthetic device. The subject focuses attention successively on the characters he wishes to communicate. The computer detects the chosen character on-line and in real time. This detection is achieved by repeatedly flashing rows and columns of the matrix. When the elements containing the chosen character are flashed, a P300 is elicited, and it is this P300 that is detected by the computer. We report an analysis of the operating characteristics of the system when used with normal volunteers, who took part in 2 experimental sessions. In the first session (the pilot study/training session) subjects attempted to spell a word and convey it to a voice synthesizer for production. In the second session (the analysis of the operating characteristics of the system) subjects were required simply to attend to individual letters of a word for a specific number of trials while data were recorded for off-line analysis. The analyses suggest that this communication channel can be operated accurately at the rate of 0.20 bits/sec. In other words, under the conditions we used, subjects can communicate 12.0 bits, or 2.3 characters, per min. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

Recently, we have proposed the detection method of error potential in order to add the fail safe function to BCI system. In this paper, feature extraction method based on morphological multi-resolution analysis is introduced to extract features concerned with motor imagery and cognition simultaneously from the EEG signals. Morphological filter is composed of nonlinear operation between signal and structural function and this multi-resolution analysis can be constructed by repeating this filtering to signal while changing structural function. This method is a kind of discrete wavelet analysis with non-linear characteristics and is effective to extract specific shapes. The structural function which decides the filter characteristic is designed to obtain optimal separation based on mutual information algorithm or spectrum dividing algorithm.},

We approach this problem by calculating the frequency of both healthy and epileptic EEG signals, and we find that all EEG signals obey the Gaussian distribution with different standard deviations. However, under some transformation, we can treat EEG signals as PRNGs. Our transformation takes the sum of the least significant five bits of the EEG sample amplitude and then outputs the parity of this sum to a binary (0 or 1) sequence. Our binary sequences have passed nearly all NIST pseudo-random number tests except a few failures. This indicates that the EEG signals can indeed become a PRNG provided that it undergoes a transformation like ours. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {"This edition has several new features, reflective of the changes that have occurred in our field over the last 5 years since the fifth edition. More and more, the field of digital recording has expanded; however, in order to understand some of the shortcomings and pitfalls of digital EEG, people need to still address the issues of basic analog recording principles. With an increased use of digital recording, laboratories have collected new and different "technical artifacts." We present here an attempt to start a database for such artifacts in a hopes that future editions will continue to expand upon this and offer a fairly complete library for beginning individuals interested in our field. As noted in the fifth edition, epilepsy monitoring units (EMU's) have continued to mushroom. Similar growth has occurred in the use of EEG monitoring in newborn, cardiac, trauma, and post-operative intensive care units. With the significant advances in wireless communication and easy access to the Internet, such recordings can also be viewed and transmitted locally virtually instantaneously and can allow for well-trained clinical neurophysiologists to see and opine about patients' conditions on a very time-relevant basis. Hopefully, as future generations may show, this ability will significantly influence our patients' outcomes. Similarly, the field of intraoperative clinical neurophysiology for spinal cord function, cranial nerve function, and cranial vascular therapies has continued to evolve along with the wireless and iInternet communications. This has allowed for close monitoring of neurologic function during critical periods of operations, again with a time course that allows for corrective actions to be taken on a meaningful time frame"-Provided by publisher.},

@article{Tibon2015,
abstract = {The cognitive events examined in many event-related potentials (ERPs) studies do not occur in a neural vacuum, and separating the signals of interest from the brain's background electrical activity generally requires averaging multiple EEG segments of a condition of interest (Luck, 2005). In addition to within-subject averaging, the vast majority of ERP studies are based on across-subject grand average data, i.e., group waveforms representing the means of subjects' averaged waveforms, with statistical significance examined by comparing variance between conditions of interest with variance between participants. Using this approach may not always portray a valid picture. Consider, for example, the following experimental paradigm: in a study of episodic associative memory, participants encoded 120 pairs of stimuli (unrelated object picture pairs in the unimodal task, and unrelated environmental sound-object picture pairs in the crossmodal task). At test, cue pictures were presented to probe recall of the associated picture (in the unimodal task) or sound (in the crossmodal task). ERPs were time-locked to the onset of the cue, and sorted post-hoc into recall-success and recall-failure trials (for details of the procedures, see Tibon and Levy, 2014a). This experimental design poses several challenges to the conventional grand-averaging method. First, since the assignment of trials to experimental conditions is based on participants' responses, it is quite likely that the data will be unbalanced (that is, an unequal number of trials in each condition). Therefore, signal-to-noise ratio and variance can vary significantly between experimental conditions. Second, since experimental conditions are mutually dependent (i.e., a participant who had 100 recall-success responses can only have 20 recall-failure responses), participants who were very successful (having a low number of recall-failure trials) or very unsuccessful (having a low number of recall-success trials) in performing the task are likely to be excluded due to an insufficient number of trials for addressing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) challenges in one of the experimental conditions.

The participants were also asked to perform a P300-based BCI spelling task. By using correlation and regression analyses, we found that only the temporal filtering capacity in the RSVP task was a predictor of both the P300-based BCI accuracy and of the amplitude of the P300 elicited performing the BCI task. We concluded that the ability to keep the attentional filter active during the selection of a target influences performance in BCI control.},

abstract = {An EEG-based brain-computer system can be used to control external devices such as computers, wheelchairs or Virtual Environments. One of the most important applications is a spelling device to aid severely disabled individuals with communication, for example people disabled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). P300-based BCI systems are optimal for spelling characters with high speed and accuracy, as compared to other BCI paradigms such as motor imagery. In this study, 100 subjects tested a P300-based BCI system to spell a 5-character word with only 5 min of training. EEG data were acquired while the subject looked at a 36-character matrix to spell the word WATER. Two different versions of the P300 speller were used: (i) the row/column speller (RC) that flashes an entire column or row of characters and (ii) a single character speller (SC) that flashes each character individually. The subjects were free to decide which version to test. Nineteen subjects opted to test both versions. The BCI system classifier was trained on the data collected for the word WATER. During the real-time phase of the experiment, the subject spelled the word LUCAS, and was provided with the classifier selection accuracy after each of the five letters. Additionally, subjects filled out a questionnaire about age, sex, education, sleep duration, working duration, cigarette consumption, coffee consumption, and level of disturbance that the flashing characters produced. 72.8{\%} (N = 81) of the subjects were able to spell with 100{\%} accuracy in the RC paradigm and 55.3{\%} (N = 38) of the subjects spelled with 100{\%} accuracy in the SC paradigm. Less than 3{\%} of the subjects did not spell any character correctly. People who slept less than 8 h performed significantly better than other subjects. Sex, education, working duration, and cigarette and coffee consumption were not statistically related to differences in accuracy. The disturbance of the flashing characters was rated with a median score of 1 on a scale from 1 to 5 (1, not disturbing; 5, highly disturbing). This study shows that high spelling accuracy can be achieved with the P300 BCI system using approximately 5 min of training data for a large number of non-disabled subjects, and that the RC paradigm is superior to the SC paradigm. 89{\%} of the 81 RC subjects were able to spell with accuracy 80-100{\%}. A similar study using a motor imagery BCI with 99 subjects showed that only 19{\%} of the subjects were able to achieve accuracy of 80-100{\%}. These large differences in accuracy suggest that with limited amounts of training data the P300-based BCI is superior to the motor imagery BCI. Overall, these results are very encouraging and a similar study should be conducted with subjects who have ALS to determine if their accuracy levels are similar. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

It can be used as a novel tool in easy setup clinical routines, to improve the rehabilitation process by mean of detecting patient´s motor intention, performing it by FES and finally receiving appropriate feedback The BCI-FES system presented here, consists of three blocks: the first one decodes the patient´s intention and it is composed by the patient, the acquisition hardware and the processing software (Emotiv EPOC{\textregistered}). The second block, based on Arduino's technology, transforms the information into a valid command signal. The last one excites the patient´s neuromuscular system by means of a FES device. In order to evaluate the cerebral activity sensed by the device, topographic maps were obtained. The BCI-FES system was able to detect the patient´s motor intention and control the FES device.

abstract = {The proportion of signal elements embedded in noise needed to detect a signal is a standard tool for investigating motion perception. This paradigm was applied to the shape domain to determine how local information is pooled into a global percept. Stimulus arrays consisted of oriented Gabor elements that sampled the circumference of concentric radial frequency (RF) patterns. Individual Gabors were oriented tangentially to the shape (signal) or randomly (noise). In different conditions, signal elements were located randomly within the entire array or constrained to fall along one of the concentric contours. Coherence thresholds were measured for RF patterns with various frequencies (number of corners) and amplitudes ("sharpness" of corners). Coherence thresholds (about 10{\%} = 15 elements) were lowest for circular shapes. Manipulating shape frequency or amplitude showed a range where thresholds remain unaffected (frequency ≤ RF4; amplitude ≤ 0.05). Increasing either parameter caused thresholds to rise. Compared to circles, thresholds increased by approximately four times for RF13 and five times for amplitudes of 0.3. Confining the signals to individual contours significantly reduced the number of elements needed to reach threshold (between 4 and 6), independent of the total number of elements on the contour or contour shape. Finally, adding external noise to the orientation of the elements had a greater effect on detection thresholds than adding noise to their position. These results provide evidence for a series of highly sensitive, shape-specific analysers which sum information globally but only from within specific annuli. These global mechanisms are tuned to position and orientation of local elements from which they pool information. The overall performance for arrays of elements can be explained by the sensitivity of multiple, independent concentric shape detectors rather than a single detector integrating information widely across space (e.g. Glass pattern detector).},

abstract = {Electric potentials and magnetic fields generated by ensembles of synchronously active neurons, either spontaneously or in response to external stimuli, provide information essential to understanding the processes underlying cognitive and sensorimotor activity. Interpreting recordings of these potentials and fields is difficult because detectors record signals simultaneously generated by various regions throughout the brain. We introduce a novel approach to this problem, the differentially variable component analysis (dVCA) algorithm, which relies on trial-to-trial variability in response amplitude and latency to identify multiple components. Using simulations we demonstrate the importance of response variability to component identification, the robustness of dVCA to noise, and its ability to characterize single-trial data. We then compare the source-separation capabilities of dVCA with those of principal component analysis and independent component analysis.

abstract = {We present a novel approach to describe a P300 by a shape-feature vector, which offers several advantages over the feature vector used by the BCI2000 system. Additionally, we present a calibration algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the shape-feature vector, the number of trials, and the electrodes needed by a Brain Computer Interface to accurately detect P300s; we also define a method to find a template that best represents, for a given electrode, the subject's P300 based on his/her own acquired signals. Our experiments with 21 subjects showed that the SWLDA's performance using our shape-feature vector was 93 {\%} , that is, 10 {\%} higher than the one obtained with BCI2000-feature's vector. The shape-feature vector is 34-dimensional for every electrode; however, it is possible to significantly reduce its dimensionality while keeping a high sensitivity. The validation of the calibration algorithm showed an averaged area under the ROC (AUROC) curve of 0.88 . Also, most of the subjects needed less than 15 trials to have an AUROC superior to 0.8 . Finally, we found that the electrode C4 also leads to better classification.},

abstract = {Abstract--The newly inaugurated Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals, which was created under the auspices of the National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health, is intended to stimulate current research and new investigations in the study of cardiovascular and other complex biomedical signals. The resource has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet.org), PhysioNet offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise.},

abstract = {There is general agreement in the brain-computer interface (BCI) community that although non-linear classifiers can provide better results in some cases, linear classifiers are preferable. Particularly, as non-linear classifiers often involve a number of parameters that must be carefully chosen. However, new non-linear classifiers were developed over the last decade. One of them is the random forest (RF) classifier. Although popular in other fields of science, RFs are not common in BCI research. In this work, we address three open questions regarding RFs in sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) BCIs: parametrization, online applicability, and performance compared to regularized linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We found that the performance of RF is constant over a large range of parameter values. We demonstrate - for the first time - that RFs are applicable online in SMR-BCIs. Further, we show in an offline BCI simulation that RFs statistically significantly outperform regularized LDA by about 3{\%}. These results confirm that RFs are practical and convenient non-linear classifiers for SMR-BCIs. Taking into account further properties of RFs, such as independence from feature distributions, maximum margin behavior, multiclass and advanced data mining capabilities, we argue that RFs should be taken into consideration for future BCIs.},

abstract = {The unique role of the EEG alpha rhythm in different states of cortical activity is still debated. The main theories regarding alpha function posit either sensory processing or attention allocation as the main processes governing its modulation. Closing and opening eyes, a well-known manipulation of the alpha rhythm, could be regarded as attention allocation from inward to outward focus though during light is also accompanied by visual change. To disentangle the effects of attention allocation and sensory visual input on alpha modulation, 14 healthy subjects were asked to open and close their eyes during conditions of light and of complete darkness while simultaneous recordings of EEG and fMRI were acquired. Thus, during complete darkness the eyes-open condition is not related to visual input but only to attention allocation, allowing direct examination of its role in alpha modulation. A data-driven ridge regression classifier was applied to the EEG data in order to ascertain the contribution of the alpha rhythm to eyes-open/eyes-closed inference in both lighting conditions. Classifier results revealed significant alpha contribution during both light and dark conditions, suggesting that alpha rhythm modulation is closely linked to the change in the direction of attention regardless of the presence of visual sensory input. Furthermore, fMRI activation maps derived from an alpha modulation time-course during the complete darkness condition exhibited a right frontal cortical network associated with attention allocation. These findings support the importance of top-down processes such as attention allocation to alpha rhythm modulation, possibly as a prerequisite to its known bottom-up processing of sensory input.},

abstract = {In most brain computer interface (BCI) systems, some target users have significant difficulty in using BCI systems. Such target users are called 'BCI-illiterate'. This phenomenon has been poorly investigated, and a clear understanding of the BCI-illiteracy mechanism or a solution to this problem has not been reported to date. In this study, we sought to demonstrate the neurophysiological differences between two groups (literate, illiterate) with a total of 52 subjects. We investigated recordings under non-task related state (NTS) which is collected during subject is relaxed with eyes open. We found that high theta and low alpha waves were noticeable in the BCI-illiterate relative to the BCI-literate people. Furthermore, these high theta and low alpha wave patterns were preserved across different mental states, such as NTS, resting before motor imagery (MI), and MI states, even though the spatial distribution of both BCI-illiterate and BCI-literate groups did not differ. From these findings, an effective strategy for pre-screening subjects for BCI illiteracy has been determined, and a performance factor that reflects potential user performance has been proposed using a simple combination of band powers. Our proposed performance factor gave an r = 0.59 (r(2) = 0.34) in a correlation analysis with BCI performance and yielded as much as r = 0.70 (r(2) = 0.50) when seven outliers were rejected during the evaluation of whole data (N = 61), including BCI competition datasets (N = 9). These findings may be directly applicable to online BCI systems.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art image classification methods require an intensive learning/training stage (using SVM, Boosting, etc.) In contrast, non-parametric nearest-neighbor (NN) based image classifiers require no training time and have other favorable properties. However, the large performance gap between these two families of approaches rendered NN-based image classifiers useless. We claim that the effectiveness of non-parametric NN-based image classification has been considerably undervalued. We argue that two practices commonly used in image classification methods, have led to the inferior performance of NN-based image classifiers: (i) Quantization of local image descriptors (used to generate "bags-of-words ", codebooks). (ii) Computation of 'image-to-image' distance, instead of 'image-to-class' distance. We propose a trivial NN-based classifier - NBNN, (Naive-Bayes nearest-neighbor), which employs NN- distances in the space of the local image descriptors (and not in the space of images). NBNN computes direct 'image- to-class' distances without descriptor quantization. We further show that under the Naive-Bayes assumption, the theoretically optimal image classifier can be accurately approximated by NBNN. Although NBNN is extremely simple, efficient, and requires no learning/training phase, its performance ranks among the top leading learning-based image classifiers. Empirical comparisons are shown on several challenging databases (Caltech-101 ,Caltech-256 and Graz-01).},

The BCI is based on steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SSVEP) and the stimuli flickering are performed at high frequency (37, 38, 39 and 40 Hz). This high frequency stimulation scheme can reduce or even eliminate visual fatigue, allowing the user to achieve a stable performance for long term BCI operation. The BCI system uses power-spectral density analysis associated to three bipolar electroencephalographic channels. As the results show, 2 subjects were reported as SSVEP-BCI illiterates (not able to use the BCI), and, consequently, 13 subjects (12 of them healthy) could navigate the wheelchair in a room with obstacles arranged in four distinct configurations. Volunteers expressed neither discomfort nor fatigue due to flickering stimulation. A transmission rate of up to 72.5 bits/min was obtained, with an average of 44.6 bits/min in four trials. These results show that people could effectively navigate a robotic wheelchair using a SSVEP-based BCI with high frequency flickering stimulation.},

abstract = {Humans perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem and what is the current state of the art? Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging, and for fun, consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos. More than just a source of “recipes,” this exceptionally authoritative and comprehensive textbook/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting them to produce descriptions of a scene. These problems are also analyzed using statistical models and solved using rigorous engineering techniques Topics and features: Structured to support active curricula and project-oriented courses, with tips in the Introduction for using the book in a variety of customized courses Presents exercises at the end of each chapter with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms and containing numerous suggestions for small mid-term projects Provides additional material and more detailed mathematical topics in the Appendices, which cover linear algebra, numerical techniques, and Bayesian estimation theory Suggests additional reading at the end of each chapter, including the latest research in each sub-field, in addition to a full Bibliography at the end of the book Supplies supplementary course material for students at the associated website, http://szeliski.org/Book/ Suitable for an upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level course in computer science or engineering, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries. Its design and exposition also make it eminently suitable as a unique reference to the fundamental techniques and current research literature in computer vision. Dr. Richard Szeliski has more than 25 years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft Research. This text draws on that experience, as well as on computer vision courses he has taught at the University of Washington and Stanford.},

abstract = {Combining low-cost wireless EEG sensors with smartphones offers novel opportunities for mobile brain imaging in an everyday context. Here we present the technical details and validation of a framework for building multi-platform, portable EEG applications with real-time 3D source reconstruction. The system - Smartphone Brain Scanner - combines an off-the-shelf neuroheadset or EEG cap with a smartphone or tablet, and as such represents the first fully portable system for real-time 3D EEG imaging. We discuss the benefits and challenges, including technical limitations as well as details of real-time reconstruction of 3D images of brain activity. We present examples of brain activity captured in a simple experiment involving imagined finger tapping, which shows that the acquired signal in a relevant brain region is similar to that obtained with standard EEG lab equipment. Although the quality of the signal in a mobile solution using an off-the-shelf consumer neuroheadset is lower than the signal obtained using high-density standard EEG equipment, we propose mobile application development may offset the disadvantages and provide completely new opportunities for neuroimaging in natural settings.},

@book{WolpawJonathanR2012,
abstract = {In the last 15 years, a recognizable surge in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research and development has emerged. This emergence has sprung from a variety of factors. For one, inexpensive computer hardware and software is now available and can support the complex high-speed analyses of brain activity that is essential is BCI. Another factor is the greater understanding of the central nervous system including the abundance of new information on the nature and functional correlates of brain signals and improved methods for recording these signals in both the short-term and long-term. And the third, and perhaps most significant factor, is the new recognition of the needs and abilities of people disabled by disorders such as cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophies. The severely disabled are now able to live for many years and even those with severely limited voluntary muscle control can now be given the most basic means of communication and control because of the recent advances in the technology, research, and applications of BCI. This book is intended to provide an introduction to and summary of essentially all major aspects of BCI research and development. Its goal is to be a comprehensive, balanced, and coordinated presentation of the field's key principles, current practice, and future prospects.},

abstract = {When historian Charles Weiner found pages of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman's notes, he saw it as a "record" of Feynman's work. Feynman himself, however, insisted that the notes were not a record but the work itself. In Supersizing the Mind, Andy Clark argues that our thinking doesn't happen only in our heads but that "certain forms of human cognizing include inextricable tangles of feedback, feed-forward and feed-around loops: loops that promiscuously criss-cross the boundaries of brain, body and world." The pen and paper of Feynman's thought are just such feedback loops, physical machinery that shape the flow of thought and enlarge the boundaries of mind. Drawing upon recent work in psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, human-computer systems, and beyond, Supersizing the Mind offers both a tour of the emerging cognitive landscape and a sustained argument in favor of a conception of mind that is extended rather than "brain-bound." The importance of this new perspective is profound. If our minds themselves can include aspects of our social and physical environments, then the kinds of social and physical environments we create can reconfigure our minds and our capacity for thought and reason.},

@article{Schalk2004,
abstract = {Many laboratories have begun to develop brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that provide communication and control capabilities to people with severe motor disabilities. Further progress and realization of practical applications depends on systematic evaluations and comparisons of different brain signals, recording methods, processing algorithms, output formats, and operating protocols. However, the typical BCI system is designed specifically for one particular BCI method and is, therefore, not suited to the systematic studies that are essential for continued progress. In response to this problem, we have developed a documented general-purpose BCI research and development platform called BCI2000. BCI2000 can incorporate alone or in combination any brain signals, signal processing methods, output devices, and operating protocols. This report is intended to describe to investigators, biomedical engineers, and computer scientists the concepts that the BC12000 system is based upon and gives examples of successful BCI implementations using this system. To date, we have used BCI2000 to create BCI systems for a variety of brain signals, processing methods, and applications. The data show that these systems function well in online operation and that BCI2000 satisfies the stringent real-time requirements of BCI systems. By substantially reducing labor and cost, BCI2000 facilitates the implementation of different BCI systems and other psychophysiological experiments. It is available with full documentation and free of charge for research or educational purposes and is currently being used in a variety of studies by many research groups.},

@article{Wolpaw2002,
abstract = {For many years people have speculated that electroencephalographic activity or other electrophysiological measures of brain function might provide a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world - a brain-computer interface (BCI). Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or 'locked in', with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates up to 10-25bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances.},
