A method to analyze EEG signals which is based on the waveform characterization is presented. The benefits of the proposed approach are twofold, (1) it has a universal applicability because the same basic methodology can be applied to detect different patterns in EEG signals with applications to BCI and (2) it has the potential to foster close collaboration with physicians and electroencephalograph technicians because the approach follows the established procedure of the clinical EEG community of analyzing waveforms by their shapes

%Sleep staging is one of the most important steps in sleep analysis. It is
%a very time consuming task consisting of classifying all 30 second pieces
%of an approximately eight hour recording into one of six sleep stages:
%wakefulness, S1 (light sleep), S2, S3, S4 (deep sleep), REM (rapid eye
%movement) sleep. A sleep recording is made with a minimum setting
%of four channels: electro-encephalogram (EEG) from electrodes C3 and
%C4 1, electro-myogram (EMG) and electro-oculogram (EOG).

%In order to classify each 30 second segment of sleep according to the classical
%[Rechtschaen  Kales 1968] (RK) rules, the human scorer looks for
%defined patterns of waveforms in the EEG, for rapid eye movements in
%the EOG and for EMG level. It is therefore a valuable goal to try and
%automate this process and quite some work has already been done in
%trying to replicate RK sleep staging with diverse automatic methods (see
%[Hasan 1983] and [Penzel et al. 1991] for overviews). There is however a
%considerable dissatisfaction within the sleep research community concerning
%the very basis of RK sleep staging [Penzel et al. 1991]: RK is based on
%a predened set of rules leaving much room for sub jective interpretation;
