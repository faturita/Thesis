\chapter{P300}

The P300~\citep{Farwell1988,Knuth2006} is a positive deflection of the EEG signal which occurs around $300$ ms after the onset of a rare and deviant stimulus that the subject is expected to attend.  It is produced under the oddball paradigm~\citep{WolpawJonathanR2012} and it is consistent across different subjects. It has a lower amplitude  ($\pm 5 \mu V $) compared to basal EEG activity, reaching a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of around $-15$ db estimated based on the amplitude of the P300 response signal divided by the standard deviation of the background EEG activity~\citep{Hu2010}.  This signal can be used to implement a speller application by means of a Speller Matrix~\citep{Farwell1988}. Fig.~\ref{fig:p300matrix} shows an example of the Speller Matrix used in the OpenVibe open source software~\citep{Renard2010}, where the flashes of rows and columns provide the deviant stimulus required to elicit this physiological response.   Each time a row or a column that contains the desired letter flashes, the corresponding synchronized EEG signal should also contain the P300 signature and by detecting it, the selected letter can be identified.
